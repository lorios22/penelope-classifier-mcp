Listen 0:00 37 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The native cryptocurrency of The Open Network has retraced 6% from its 24-hour high after United Arab Emirates regulators refuted claims that staking Toncoin (TON) could create a pathway to UAE residency. Toncoin initially shot up 10% to $3.03 on Sunday after The Open Network claimed that applicants staking $100,000 worth of Toncoin for three years make applicants eligible for the UAE’s golden visa program. However, the cryptocurrency partially retraced after the Emirates News Agency shared a joint statement from several regulators denying that claim. TON is now trading at $2.84, a 6% decrease from its recently posted 24-hour high. UAE disputes golden visa claim TON claimed that applicants who stake $100,000 worth of TON for three years and pay a one-time $35,000 processing fee would be eligible for a 10-year golden visa. Telegram CEO Pavel Durov added to the speculation by reposting the announcement on X from crypto influencer Ash Crypto on Sunday, though he has made no official comment. However, the Emirates News Agency later reported on Monday that the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security, the Securities and Commodities Authority, and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority have said golden visas are not issued to digital asset holders. They also clarified that digital currency investments are governed by specific regulations and are unrelated to golden visa eligibility. “The authority further confirmed that digital currency investments are governed by specific regulations and are unrelated to golden visa eligibility. It urged investors to obtain information from credible, official sources to avoid misinformation or fraud,” the Emirates News Agency reported. Cointelegraph reached out to the TON Foundation and CEO Max Crown for comment. Source: Sanjay Golden visa eligibility The golden visa is a long-term residency visa introduced by the UAE government in 2019 to attract skilled individuals to the region. It enables foreign nationals to live, work, and study in the UAE without needing a national sponsor, with visa durations ranging from five to 10 years, according to the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security. Related: ‘Is this real?’ CZ questions TON’s UAE Golden Visa as gov’t sources stay silent To be eligible, users must meet strict criteria, such as having special skills, like being a doctor, scientist, or researcher. Investors can receive a golden visa if they have public investments worth 2 million United Arab Emirates dirham ($544,000) or more. Entrepreneurs can also be eligible if they own a registered startup recognized by the UAE authorities that is tech-based. Magazine: Dogecoin set for rebound?

    "source": "Unknown Source",
    "content": "Amin Haqshanas 2 hours ago Update: UAE Denies TON golden visa claim After TON claimed a staking program would offer golden visas for holders to enter the United Arab Emirates, the country's news agency shot down the idea of a partnership. Listen 0:00 16425 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Update (July 6, 12 pm UTC): This article has been updated to include comments from Sigil Fund partner Joe HedgeHog. Editor’s Note: This article has been substantially updated to include the denial from the UAE press office. The Open Network (TON), the blockchain platform spun out of Telegram, unveiled what it described as a new pathway to UAE residency, offering 10-year Golden Visas to applicants who stake $100,000 worth of Toncoin (TON) for three years and pay a one-time $35,000 processing fee. “Secure your Golden Visa in under 7 weeks from document submission to the Visa Office,” TON announced Saturday, detailing that its UAE-based partners will manage the visa processing and residency status confirmation. However, Emirates News Agency (WAM) clarified in a later press release that The Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP), the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) have issued a joint statement that golden visas are not issued to digital asset holders. “The authority further confirmed that digital currency investments are governed by specific regulations and are unrelated to golden visa eligibility. It urged investors to obtain information from credible, official sources to avoid misinformation or fraud,” according to WAM. According to the press release, VARA also clarified that the company TON is neither licensed nor regulated by VARA. According to the original claim, applicants retain control of their assets during the staking period through a decentralized smart contract verifiable on the TON blockchain. Furthermore, the program promises estimated annual yields of 3% to 4% on staked assets, adding an incentive for crypto investors. The Golden Visa would supposedly extend coverage to immediate family members, including spouses, children, and parents, at no additional cost beyond standard government fees. Source: TON Related: Toncoin surges as Pavel Durov leaves France after months TON lowers golden visa entry cost by 80% Conventional UAE Golden Visa routes usually demand a minimum $540,000 investment in illiquid assets. In contrast, TON’s program was suggesting just $100,000 in staked TON, offering a significantly lower entry point. “The entry is 5x lower than an equivalent real estate / FD investment and will certainly get the attention of whales to take a look at TON and consider this as an option,” Bobby Ong, co-founder of CoinGecko, wrote on X. Source: Bobby Ong Following the announcement, Toncoin’s price surged over 10%. At the time of writing, the token is trading at around $2.98, up by more than 8% over the past day. The token is still down by more than 60% over the past year, according to data from CoinMarketCap. However, some have raised doubts about the significance of TON’s Golden Visa program, noting that it isn’t an official partnership with the UAE government. “3rd party provider is using TON as a proxy to help their clients get golden visa for entrepreneurs. They could have used FARTCOIN instead,” Sigil Fund partner Joe HedgeHog wrote on X. Related: TON blockchain network back online after brief outage UAE to cement status as blockchain hub The crypto-based residency program comes as the UAE pushes to establish itself as a primary destination for blockchain and crypto projects. Last month, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), the financial regulator in charge of the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), approved Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin . In May, Dubai’s crypto regulator updated its guidelines to include provisions for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Lawyer Irina Heaver told Cointelegraph these rules give issuers and exchanges a clear path to launch and trade tokenized real estate assets . Meanwhile, the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre free zone has attracted over 600 crypto companies , with more firms flocking to the Dubai International Financial Centre and One Central district as the country positions itself as a leader in digital finance.

Arkham firm added that the eight transfers — which moved 10,000 Bitcoin at a time from eight wallets that were untouched for over 14 years — may be possibly due to the owner upgrading from the original legacy wallet to a Native SegWit address, which are said to have improved security and lower fees. “Yesterday’s $8 billion transfers were possibly related to address upgrades, moving from 1-addresses to bc1q-addresses,” Arkham said. Drake drops Bitcoin reference in new song Musical artist Drake mentioned Bitcoin ( BTC ) in his latest song \"What Did I Miss?\" The song was released on Saturday and is already drawing attention from Bitcoiners on social media. Drake previously bet $1 million in BTC on the outcome of the 2022 Super Bowl; the championship game of the American contact sport. The specific verse from the song goes: \"I look at this shit like a BTC, could be down this week, then I'm up next week. I don't give a fuck if you love me. I don't give a fuck if you like me. Askin' me 'How did it feel?' Can't say it didn't surprise me.\" Pop culture references to Bitcoin indicate that the digital asset is gradually shifting from a niche phenomenon into the mainstream.

Former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has questioned the legitimacy of The Open Network’s new pathway to UAE residency, noting the absence of any official announcement from UAE government sources. As Cointelegraph reported , The Open Network announced on Saturday that 10-year UAE Golden Visas will be available to applicants who stake at least $100,000 worth of Toncoin (TON) for three years and pay a $35,000 processing fee. The visa could reportedly be secured in under seven weeks. “Is this real?” CZ asked on X in response to the announcement. “It would be awesome IF it is true.

In response to CZ’s post, some X users pointed out that Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has confirmed the news. Durov reposted the announcement on X from crypto influencer Ash Crypto. Even so, CZ had reservations, stating he likes to “trust but verify.” Source: CZ Nevertheless, the announcement was enough to send TON’s price sharply higher, with the token rallying more than 11% within a few hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Cointelegraph could not independently verify the news, as the announcement did not appear on the websites of the Ras Al Khaimah Emirate DAO, Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) or Abu Dhabi Global Market Authority as of Sunday afternoon. Shortly after Cointelegraph’s report, UAE regulators — including the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP), the SCA and VARA — issued a joint statement denying claims that golden visas were being offered to cryptocurrency investors. “The ICP clarified that golden visas are issued according to clear and officially approved frameworks and criteria, which do not include digital currency investors,” the statement read. “Eligible categories include real estate investors, entrepreneurs, exceptional talents, scientists and specialists, top students and graduates, humanitarian pioneers, and frontline workers.” In the statement, VARA “strongly urged investors and consumers to deal exclusively with fully licensed and regulated companies when engaging in services and investments related to virtual assets.” Related: Telegram founder Durov on arrest, detention in France: ‘I’m confused’ UAE has become a leading crypto and blockchain hub The UAE has emerged as a rapidly growing hub for cryptocurrency adoption and blockchain-based companies, thanks to its favorable regulatory environment, government support and infrastructure that welcomes DeFi and Web3 projects.

The new sandbox, developed in partnership with layer-1 blockchain peaq, aims to reward tokenholders with a share of the revenues generated by machine economy activities. The initiative also seeks to create real-world use cases for decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) networks. The UAE has also positioned itself as a key player in tokenized real estate , with Dubai launching the first licensed tokenized real estate project in the Middle East and North Africa. The initiative is a collaboration between the Central Bank of the UAE, the Dubai Futures Foundation and the Dubai Land Department.

Despite this challenging macro environment, “Blockchain infrastructure remains the lead story in the crypto space,” said Kaden Stadelmann, chief technology officer at Komodo Platform. He noted that the key crypto themes still attracting investment include AI, decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) , tokenization, payments and RWAs. In June, several high-profile funding deals reflected this continued interest, with decentralized finance (DeFi), trading platforms, pre-seed growth funds and projects at the intersection of digital assets and artificial intelligence all securing capital. The latest VC Roundup takes a deeper look at these deals against a backdrop of seasonal volatility that could limit dealmaking in the near term.

The funding round included backing from DACM, Delphi Ventures, Arche Capital and Lvna Capital. Inference Labs is developing Proof of Inference, a cryptographic method that validates AI outputs using zero-knowledge proofs . Zero-knowledge technology has gained traction within the crypto ecosystem for its ability to ensure the safety and privacy of transactions.

    "content": "Dominic Schwenter 10 hours ago Crypto adoption will be driven by high-growth markets, with or without the US Crypto adoption is rapidly growing in high-growth markets, where the technology is solving real-world problems, like remittances, financial inclusion and supply chain inefficiencies. Listen 0:00 1787 Opinion COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Opinion by: Dominic Schwenter, chief operating officer of Lisk The US is in the middle of a crypto boom. Exchange-traded fund approvals have opened the door to institutional adoption, liquidity is increasing and regulatory clarity is beginning to take shape under a more crypto-aligned administration. Filings from the Securities and Exchange Commission referencing blockchain hit an all-time high in February 2025, signaling a broader shift in how seriously the technology is being taken at the highest levels. This momentum is good for the industry. US-based crypto companies have spent nearly a decade building through regulatory uncertainty, and they deserve the attention and rewards that are finally arriving. Is institutional support finally showing up? It’s overdue — and well-earned. Zooming in on the US too much, however, puts the industry at risk of missing what’s happening elsewhere. Some of the most important crypto adoption today takes root in places far outside the spotlight. The most exciting crypto adoption isn’t happening on Wall Street. It is unfolding in high-growth markets where people use crypto not to speculate but out of necessity. These communities didn’t wait for headlines. They built through every cycle and are now setting the pace for where Web3 is going next. High-growth markets are leading in adoption Fifteen of the top 20 countries on Chainalysis’s 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index are in high-growth regions such as Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Nigeria. These aren’t just speculative hotspots. In many of these countries, crypto is part of daily life. Unlike boom-and-bust markets, adoption here hasn’t wavered. It is grounded in utility. In many of these economies, crypto helps families facilitate remittances, offers a safer way to store value when local currencies aren’t stable and lets small businesses move money without friction. In the West, crypto still carries the sheen of a high-risk investment. In high-growth markets, it’s already embedded into daily life. That’s what real adoption looks like. Builders are shifting to high-growth markets As steady, practical usage rises, builder activity follows. Currently, the global developer map is changing fast. According to the 2024 Electric Capital Developer Report, Asia now accounts for 32% of active crypto developers — a massive jump from just 12% in 2015. Over the same period, the US’s share dropped sharply, to 19% from 38%. The blockchain talent pool isn’t shrinking; it’s moving to where the momentum is. Additionally, 41% of all new crypto developers now come from Asia, illustrating a growing pipeline of builders emerging outside of traditional tech hubs. These aren’t just hobbyists but the next wave of founders, architects and engineers choosing to build closer to the problems crypto can solve. Related: Xend Finance, Risevest launch tokenized stocks platform in Africa This shift isn’t limited to Central Asia. Africa, South America and Southeast Asia are all seeing steady increases in developer activity, while North America and Europe continue to decline in relative share. The message is clear: Web3 innovation is no longer anchored to a single geography. It’s driven by builders who are closer to real-world needs — and who are designing for them. Blockchain solving real problems The surge in developer activity and adoption across high-growth markets isn’t happening in a vacuum. Instead, it’s tied to real-world effects. For example, nine of South Africa’s largest food and beverage wholesalers have partnered with LovCash, a blockchain-powered end-to-end digital payments platform, to digitize the country’s informal trade economy. In just five months, over 3,700 mom-and-pop shops have joined the platform, a rapid shift toward a more connected, cashless ecosystem. Blockchain is serving as a trusted tech infrastructure for South Africa’s informal supply chain. In regions where traditional infrastructure is often fragmented or absent, LovCash enables seamless, cashless transactions between small, often unbanked retailers and wholesalers. Beyond simplifying payments, the system provides wholesalers with real-time insights into sales trends and product demand, enabling smarter planning and reducing waste. There’s no token speculation here, no flashy NFTs; just a real-world solution to a real-world supply chain challenge. A call to action for Web3 builders What’s happening in the US is worthy of celebration, but it’s not the whole story. Real-world adoption, momentum from builders and real use cases are accelerating in high-growth markets, where crypto is already making a difference. This is where Web3’s long-term effect will be shaped. Builders and investors should stop waiting for validation from Washington or Wall Street and start paying attention to the places where the tech is solving real problems right now. Crypto didn’t wait for the US to matter. If the goal is to build something truly global, it’s time to follow the people already using it to make things work.

BTC price and SOL price targets are $230,000 and $4,390, respectively. SOL/USD would need to deliver gains of nearly 3,000% to hit the breakout top level. Bitcoin ( BTC ) can reach $230,000 if a classic breakout move completes successfully, a new prediction states. In his latest analysis , the popular X content creator, Trader Alan, delivered a giant $4,390 Solana ( SOL ) price target. Solana “waiting” for breakout with $4,390 target Bitcoin has spent seven weeks acting within a narrow range , but as time goes on, anticipation is growing as to where BTC price action will head next. For Trader Alan, a familiar chart pattern holds the key — and so far, progress is exactly what bulls are hoping for. “Bitcoin and Solana Cup and Handle Pattern on monthly chart,” he told X followers, adding that SOL/USD is currently attempting to copy BTC. A cup-and-handle pattern is a well-known bullish setup in which price returns to a previous high, consolidates and then continues higher, often with explosive results. As Cointelegraph reported , BTC/USD has already completed a long-term cup and handle, from its 2021 peak to 2022 low and back up, followed by its first trip to the $100,000 mark. “$BTC has broken out the handle while $SOL is still waiting for the breakout,” Alan claims about the latest iterations of the pattern, which in Bitcoin’s case extends the breakout beyond the 2021 high. “This pattern sets $BTC and $SOL to targets of $230,000 and $4,390 respectively.” BTC/USD vs. SOL/USD comparison.

    "content": "Amin Haqshanas 12 hours ago Vitalik proposes gas cap to enhance Ethereum security, stability Vitalik Buterin proposes EIP-7983 to cap transaction gas at 16.77 million, aiming to boost Ethereum security, stability, and zkVM compatibility. Listen 0:00 8447 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and researcher Toni Wahrstätter have put forward EIP-7983, which aims to introduce a protocol-level cap on transaction gas usage to increase network security and performance. The proposal sets a maximum gas limit of 16.77 million (2²⁴) for individual transactions. “By implementing this limit, Ethereum can enhance its resilience against certain DoS vectors, improve network stability, and provide more predictability to transaction processing costs,” the proposal reads. Under the current Ethereum ( ETH ) architecture, a single transaction can theoretically consume the entire block’s gas limit, posing a risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and leading to unpredictable network behavior. By capping individual transactions, EIP-7983 seeks to distribute gas consumption more evenly, reducing the chance of single transactions overwhelming block capacity. Source: Cointelegraph Related: Vitalik Buterin’s vision for Ethereum: Pectra, Glamsterdam and beyond Gas cap to boost zkVM compatibility The proposed cap is also designed to improve compatibility with zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs) by encouraging large transactions to be split into smaller chunks. According to the draft, transactions specifying gas limits beyond 16.77 million would be rejected during block validation, ensuring they cannot enter the network or be included in new blocks. The cap is independent of the overall block gas limit, which miners and validators can still adjust within existing consensus rules. Buterin and Wahrstätter chose 16.77 million as the cap to balance complexity and performance, arguing it accommodates current advanced DeFi use cases and contract deployments without introducing unnecessary risks. “This value enables most current use cases including contract deployments and advanced DeFi interactions while ensuring consistent performance characteristics,” the proposal reads. While the proposal isn’t backward-compatible for transactions exceeding the new limit, the authors noted that most existing transactions fall well below the cap, minimizing the impact on users and developers. EIP-7983 builds on prior efforts, like EIP-7825, to improve predictability in transaction execution. Related: Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scaling Vitalik wants to make Ethereum simple In May, Buterin called for simplifying the Ethereum network’s base protocol to boost efficiency, security, and accessibility, inspired by Bitcoin’s minimalist approach. At the time, he proposed restructuring Ethereum’s architecture across consensus, execution, and shared components to achieve a leaner design within five years. Buterin argued that Ethereum’s growing complexity has led to longer development times, higher costs, and increased security risks. More recently, the Ethereum mastermind introduced a new kind of digital identity system dubbed “pluralistic identity,” arguing it could protect privacy while enabling fair participation in digital life.

Listen 0:00 15246 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The US Secret Service has quietly seized nearly $400 million in digital assets over the past decade, amassing one of the world’s largest crypto cold wallets, Bloomberg reported Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter. The agency’s Global Investigative Operations Center (GIOC) has tracked funds through open-source tools, blockchain analysis, and patience, Jamie Lam, an investigative analyst with the US Secret Service, reportedly told law enforcement officials in Bermuda last month. The agency’s crypto trove, much of which sits in a single cold-storage wallet, results from a string of investigations into scams. Scammers lure targets into seemingly legitimate crypto investment platforms in one typical scheme. Victims often see initial profits before the sites vanish with their deposits. “That’s how they do it,” Lam said. “They’ll send you a photo of a really good-looking guy or girl. But it’s probably some old guy in Russia.” Source: US Secret Service Related: Brazil’s central bank service provider hacked, $140M stolen Blockchain trails unmask crypto scams Lam’s team uses domain records, blockchain transactions, and VPN slip-ups to identify fraudsters. In one case, a cryptocurrency payment led investigators to another wallet. In another one, a brief VPN failure exposed an IP address, helping agents piece together the scam’s digital trail. At the helm of the Secret Service’s crypto strategy is Kali Smith, who directs a team that has trained officials in over 60 countries to unmask online financial crimes. The agency has focused on jurisdictions with weak oversight or programs selling residency to foreign nationals. “Sometimes after just a week-long training, they can be like, ‘Wow, we didn’t even realize that this is occurring in our country,’” Smith said. The Secret Service’s work has uncovered scams ranging from romance-investment schemes to sextortion cases. One investigation involved an Idaho teenager who sent a nude photo to an online stranger. The scammer extorted $300 twice before the teen went to the police. Analysts traced the payments through another coerced teenager acting as a money mule, leading to an account tied to nearly $4.1 million in transactions under a Nigerian passport. British police arrested the suspected extortionist when he arrived in Guildford, England, where he remains in custody pending extradition.

Listen 0:00 9761 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Blockchain intelligence firm Arkham says the recent $8.6 billion in Bitcoin that was moved on Thursday for the first time in over 14 years doesn’t appear to be heading for a sell-off. “There are no indications that this whale is selling Bitcoin,” Arkham said in an X post on Friday. Arkham added that the eight transfers — which moved 10,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ) at a time from eight wallets that were untouched for over 14 years — may be possibly due to the owner upgrading from the original legacy wallet to a Native SegWit address, which is said to have improved security and lower fees. Arkham says Bitcoin transfer “possibly related” to wallet upgrade “Yesterday’s $8 billion transfers were possibly related to address upgrades, moving from 1-addresses to bc1q-addresses,” Arkham said. Source: Arkham Arkham said earlier on Friday that all the Bitcoin was originally deposited into the wallets on April 2 or May 4, 2011, and remained untouched for more than 14 years. The firm added that the Bitcoin is now stored in eight new wallets and hasn’t been moved since. In a post on the same day, blockchain research firm 10x Research said that while there’s no clear evidence a large amount of Bitcoin is being prepared for sale, its analysis has “long suggested that early holders are gradually offloading into ETF and corporate treasury demand.” CZ says he got in “too late” after whale move Only in February, prominent Bitcoiner PlanB revealed that he converted all of his Bitcoin holdings to spot Bitcoin ETFs. “Not having to hassle with keys gives me peace of mind. I guess I am not a maxi anymore,” PlanB said in a Feb. 15 X post. Meanwhile, Coinbase’s head of product, Conor Grogan, raised a more alarming possibility. Grogan said there’s a slight chance a hack caused the $8.6 billion Bitcoin transfer, and if so, it could be the largest robbery ever. Related: Bitcoin miners gambled on AI last year, and it paid off “If true (again, I’m speculating on straws here), this would be by far the largest heist in human history,” Grogan said in an X post on Friday, The transfers caught the attention of the broader crypto industry, with some taking a light-hearted approach. Binance former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said , “I got into crypto too late.” “After seeing the 2011 whales casually moving crypto they got for $0.1,” Zhao added.

On July 6, Max Crown, CEO of the TON Foundation, announced on X a \"groundbreaking initiative\" offering toncoin TON $ 2.8492 holders the \"exclusive chance\" to secure a 10-year UAE Golden Visa. The program requires applicants to stake $100,000 worth of toncoin for three years and pay a one-time processing fee of $35,000. After the three-year lock-up period, staked funds can apparently be unlocked, and during this time, applicants reportedly earn an estimated 3–4% annual percentage yield (APY) on their staked tokens.

The TON Foundation’s website highlights several key alleged benefits: fast approval within seven weeks from document submission, a simple process without the need to purchase real estate or meet income thresholds, and inclusion of family members — spouse, children, and parents — at no extra cost beyond standard government fees. The staking is conducted through decentralized smart contracts on the TON blockchain, which it argues ensures transparency and security. The program claims to offer a capital-efficient alternative to traditional UAE Golden Visa routes, which the TON Foundation says typically require a minimum investment of approximately $540,000 in real estate or fixed deposits, often tied to illiquid assets and longer processing times. The TON Golden Visa initiative is touted as a faster, more affordable, and digitally native pathway to UAE residency, aligning with the country’s ambition to become a global crypto and Web3 hub. The announcement had an immediate impact on toncoin’s market performance. Shortly after the news broke, toncoin’s price surged by 12%. At the time of writing, the token trades around $2.8944, reflecting a 5.36% increase over the past 24 hours. Additionally, the current 24-hour average trading volume is approximately 251.54% higher than the 30-day average, signaling heightened market interest and activity, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. Despite the enthusiasm, the announcement has generated controversy within the crypto community. Bobby Ong, co-founder and COO of CoinGecko, praised the partnership as an “amazing story” that could attract whales and provide strong buy support for toncoin, although he expressed hope that the initiative is not a temporary scheme. Conversely, \"Joe HedgedHog\" (\"@JoeHedgedHog\" on X) , an investment partner at Sigil Fund, pointed out that this is not an official UAE government partnership but rather a third-party legal firm using TON as a proxy to assist clients applying for the Golden Visa under the entrepreneur category. He noted that the firm could have used any cryptocurrency and that the staking requirement serves more as a token utility sink than a government mandate. Further skepticism came from \"ivangbi\" (\"@ivangbi_\" on X) , the Head of Strategy & Business Development at Gearbox Protocol, who described the announcement as misleading. According to this perspective, the legal firm receives the non-refundable $35,000 fee and attempts to submit applications to the UAE government, which ultimately decides on approval. He argued that the staked TON balance is only one of several requirements and may no longer be relevant under updated rules. He went on to say that the absence of blanket approval for TON stakers means that acceptance is uncertain, and the program may primarily serve as a marketing tool coupled with token utility. Changpeng Zhao (CZ) , co-founder and former CEO of Binance, expressed cautious interest in the TON Foundation’s UAE Golden Visa announcement but highlighted several uncertainties. He noted conflicting information about the program’s legitimacy, including claims that the $35,000 fee mainly goes to a legal agent rather than the government, and that the website’s language may misleadingly suggest a guaranteed visa upon staking $100,000 in toncoin. CZ also mentioned that theUAE regulators classify staking as a regulated activity for which TON may lack licenses. Importantly, he pointed out that official UAE government channels do not currently recognize staking toncoin as a visa qualification, listing the standard Golden Visa categories instead. In a follow-up post , CZ reiterated his cautious optimism, emphasizing the need to “trust but verify.” He acknowledged the potential benefits of such a program but stressed that official government partnerships and announcements are essential for legitimacy—none of which have yet been confirmed. His stance balances support for innovation and TON founder Pavel Durov with prudent skepticism about the program’s current status. The UAE entrepreneur visa category, which this program appears to target, is designed for individuals owning economic projects of a technical or innovative nature. Applicants must provide approval letters from an accredited UAE auditor confirming the project’s value (at least 500,000 AED) , local authorities verifying the project’s innovative character, and an accredited UAE business incubator to establish the proposed activity in the country. Technical Analysis Highlights Price surged from $2.75 to a peak of $3.06, representing an overall range of $0.34 (12.4%) . Rally began abruptly during the 7:00 hour on 6 July, when volume spiked to nearly 13 million. Extraordinary 57.5 million volume surge in the 8:00 hour propelled TON to its high. Support has formed around $2.86-$2.89 with high-volume buying. Resistance appears at $3.03, suggesting the token has established a new trading range. In the last 60 minutes from 6 July 15:12 to 16:11, TON experienced a significant price surge of 2.4%. Dramatic breakout occurred at 15:48 when volume spiked to 1.68 million tokens. Token reached a peak of $2.93 at 15:50 before establishing a new support level around $2.90-$2.91.

Bitcoin briefly topped $109,000, while XRP, Solana's SOL, and Dogecoin also saw significant gains. The U.S. is nearing several trade deals before the July 9 deadline, after which higher tariffs may be reinstated if negotiations fail. Major cryptocurrencies rose Sunday morning as the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted at upcoming trade deals before the July 9 Liberation Day tariff deadline. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, gained over 1%, briefly topping $109,000. Payments-focused XRP and Solana's SOL token gained over 2% each, with meme token dogecoin DOGE $ 0.1713 rising 3%, according to data source CoinDesk. Ethereum's ether, the second-largest token, rose 1.5% to $2,550. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story.  today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  and  . In an interview with CNN, Bessent stated that the U.S. is close to finalizing several trade deals ahead of the July 9 deadline, when the temporary pause in higher tariffs initially announced on April 2 is set to expire. \"President Trump's going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don't move things along, then on August 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level. So I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,\" Bessent said, per Reuters . Bessent explained that July 9 remains the deadline for negotiations, failing which higher tariffs, announced in early April, will take effect from Aug. 1. \"We are saying this is when it's happening. If you want to speed things up, have at it. If you want to go back to the old rate, that's your choice,\" Bessent told CNN, adding that some countries were 'foot-dragging' on getting to deals. Since taking office early this year, President Donald Trump has been focused on making the U.S. wealthy again by imposing tariffs on goods imported from other countries, a coercive tactic aimed at rebalancing trade relations and reducing the U.S. trade deficit. Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2, starting with a 10% base tax on all trading partners and additional amounts on many countries, with some ranging as high as 50%. The so-called Liberation Day announcement triggered a sell-off in financial markets, with U.S. stocks taking a significant hit alongside a sharp decline in bitcoin, which fell to $75,000. The panic likely prompted the Trump administration to announce a 90-day pause a week later. Since then, the so-called U.S. exceptionalism has resurfaced in financial markets, lifting major U.S. equity indices to record highs. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have outperformed their global peers, with BTC rallying to trade above $100,000.

Idle mempool suggests an impending crisis, according to one observer. One expert calls low activity evidence of a lack of retail participation in the bitcoin market. The Bitcoin blockchain lacks meaningful on-chain activity, even as its native token, bitcoin BTC $ 109,050.61 , trades near a record per-unit price. That's according to mempool – a holding area for unconfirmed blockchain transactions waiting to be included in a block by miners. On Satuday, the mempool had just 5,000 odd transactions awaiting inclusion, with the tally rising to 15,000 at press time, still a far cry from 150,000 when BTC's price first rose above $100,000 in late 2024, according to data source Blockchain.com .

    "content": "Markets Share Share this article Copy link X icon X (Twitter) LinkedIn Facebook Email Chart of the Week: Wall Street Has Claimed Bitcoin—Now What? Bitcoin's correlation with U.S. equities is still very high, while it has almost zero relation to gold and USD. By Aoyon Ashraf | Edited by Francisco Rodrigues Jul 6, 2025, 1:00 p.m. Wall Street sign with American flags and New York Stock Exchange in Manhattan, New York City, USA. (Getty Images) What to know : Wall Street's influence has transformed bitcoin from an anti-establishment asset to a macro-driven risk asset. Bitcoin's correlation with U.S. equities has increased, challenging its status as a hedge or 'digital gold.' The market now views bitcoin similarly to traditional stocks, with its price influenced by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. \"Wall Street is coming for bitcoin.\" That phrase used to spark both hope and fear across crypto circles. Today, it's no longer a future threat or a bullish promise—it's just reality. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story.  today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  and  . The original premise of bitcoin (or crypto in general) —an asset that is censorship-resistant and doesn't answer to any traditional financial institution or government—is fading fast as Wall Street giants (as well as powerful political figures) continue to establish their strong foothold in the digital assets space. During the early years of the digital assets revolution, bitcoin was celebrated as uncorrelated and unapologetically anti-establishment. TradFi asset classes like S&P 500 would rise and fall—bitcoin didn't care. What bitcoin did care about were the flaws in the traditional financial system, which are still here to this day. A major example in BTC’s history that’s not-so-talked about anymore is the 2013 Cyprus banking crisis. The crisis, which occurred due to overexposure of banks to overleveraged local property companies and amid Europe’s debt crisis, saw deposits above 100,000 euros get a substantial haircut. In fact, 47.5% of uninsured deposits were seized. Bitcoin’s response was to move sharply upward to, for the first time in its history, cross the $1,000 threshold. After a prolonged bear market over the collapse of Mt. Gox , the idea of mass adoption grew, with Wall Street's entry into the sector seen as a stamp of validation for bitcoin as it meant more liquidity, mass adoption and price maturity. That changed everything. The price might have matured, as evidenced by waning volatility . But let’s face it—bitcoin is now just another macro-driven risk asset. \"Bitcoin, once celebrated for its low correlation to mainstream financial assets, has increasingly exhibited sensitivity to the same variables that drive equity markets over short time frames,\" said NYDIC Research in a report. In fact, the correlation is now hovering near the higher end of the historical range, according to NYDIG's calculations. \"Bitcoin’s correlation with U.S. equities remained elevated through the end of the quarter, closing at 0.48, a level near the higher end of its historical range.\" Bitcoin's correlation with S&P 500, gold and USD. (NYDIG Research) Simply put, when there is blood on the street (Wall Street that is) , bitcoin bleeds too. When Wall Street sneezes, bitcoin catches a cold. Even bitcoin's “digital gold” moniker is under pressure. NYDIG notes that bitcoin’s correlation to physical gold and the U.S. dollar is near zero. So much for the “hedge” argument—at least for now. Risk asset So why the shift? The answer is simple: to Wall Street, bitcoin is just another risk asset, not digital gold, which is synonymous with \"safe haven.\" Investors are repricing everything from central bank policy whiplash to geopolitical tension—digital assets included. \"This persistent correlation strength with U.S. equities can largely be attributed to a series of macroeconomic and geopolitical developments, the tariff turmoil and the rising number of global conflicts, which significantly influenced investor sentiment and asset repricing across markets,\" said NYDIG. And like it or not, this is here to stay—at least for a short to medium-term. As long as central bank policy, macro, and war-linked red headlines hit the tape, bitcoin will likely move in tandem with equities. \"The current correlation regime may persist as long as global risk sentiment, central bank policy, and geopolitical flashpoints remain dominant market narratives,\" NYDIG's report said. For the maxis and long-term holders, the original vision hasn't changed. Bitcoin's limited supply, borderless access, and decentralized nature remain untouched. Just don't expect them to impact price action just yet. For now, the market sees bitcoin as just another stock ticker. Just balance your trade strategies accordingly.

By Siamak Masnavi , CD Analytics | Edited by Aoyon Ashraf Jul 5, 2025, 9:40 p.m. ETH rebounds from support and consolidates near $2,515 on July 5, 2025 What to know : ETH is trading around $2,505, up 0.56% in the past 24 hours as bulls defend $2,500 support. SharpLink Gaming reaffirmed its Ethereum treasury strategy on July 4, and said Ethereum is becoming global finance’s foundational layer. The firm holds nearly 200K ETH and stakes its entire treasury across Ethereum-native protocols. At the time of writing, Ether ETH $ 2,563.32 is trading at around $2,505, up 0.56% in the past 24-hours, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. As for the broader crypto market as gauged by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) , it is up 0.34% during the same period. SharpLink Gaming, Inc. (SBET) is a pioneering online performance marketing company specializing in the sports betting and iGaming industries. Headquartered in Minneapolis, SharpLink leverages its AI-powered C4 platform to deliver personalized, data-driven marketing content that enhances customer acquisition and retention for sportsbook and casino operators. The company has expanded through strategic acquisitions and partnerships, establishing itself as a leader in the evolving sports betting ecosystem. On July 4, 2025, SharpLink announced on X that it has become the first publicly listed company to adopt ETH as its primary treasury reserve asset. The company outlined a comprehensive treasury strategy focused on accumulating ETH, staking it, and growing ETH-per-share to create long-term shareholder value.

SharpLink emphasized that its goal is not just to hold ETH but to actively deploy it through native staking, restaking, and Ethereum-based yield strategies. The company highlighted ETH's advantages as a corporate reserve asset: it is productive via staking rewards, composable across decentralized finance protocols, scarce, secure, and aligned with the infrastructure of the future internet. This approach represents a bold redefinition of traditional treasury management, integrating decentralized finance principles into corporate finance. This strategic pivot began with a $425 million private placement announced on May 27, led by Consensys and other prominent crypto investors, to fund the acquisition of ETH as SharpLink’s primary treasury asset. Joseph Lubin, Ethereum co-founder and founder of Consensys, joined SharpLink’s Board of Directors as Chairman upon closing this placement, reinforcing the company’s commitment to blockchain innovation. Since officially launching its ETH treasury strategy on June 2, SharpLink has aggressively expanded its Ethereum holdings. Between May 30 and June 12, 2025, the company acquired approximately 176,271 ETH for about $463 million at an average price of $2,626 per ETH. Following this, from June 16 to June 20, SharpLink purchased an additional 12,207 ETH for roughly $30.7 million, funded in part by $27.7 million raised through At-The-Market (ATM) equity sales. By June 24, SharpLink’s ETH holdings reached 188,478 ETH, with 100% of these reserves deployed in staking solutions generating staking rewards. And by July 1, the treasury expanded further to 198,478 ETH, yielding over 220 ETH in staking rewards since the strategy’s inception. Joseph Lubin has stated that embedding Ethereum at the core of SharpLink’s capital strategy embodies technological progress and institutional trust, positioning the company to lead the evolution of digital commerce. Meanwhile, CEO Rob Phythian has noted that SharpLink’s upcoming Nasdaq closing bell ceremony on July 7, 2025, will symbolize this new chapter, showcasing how digital assets can coexist with public market discipline and corporate governance. SharpLink’s Ethereum treasury strategy uniquely positions the company at the crossroads of sports betting, blockchain technology, and decentralized finance, offering investors regulated and transparent exposure to Ethereum’s growth potential while advancing SharpLink’s mission to innovate the multi-billion-dollar iGaming industry. Technical Analysis Highlights ETH gained 2.2% from July 4 15:00 to July 5 14:00, climbing from $2,475.48 to $2,530.02. A sharp sell-off between 13:06 and 14:05 pushed ETH down to $2,514.85 before buyers stepped in. Strong support formed between $2,480 and $2,500 during the July 5 16:00 hour, with 382,821 ETH traded. A bullish breakout on July 4 at 22:00 lifted ETH above $2,520, with resistance confirmed near $2,530. ETH consolidated around $2,515 with signs of reduced volatility and an ascending recovery trendline after 13:40. Momentum remains neutral short-term but structurally bullish given broader uptrend since late June.

By Siamak Masnavi , CD Analytics | Edited by Aoyon Ashraf Jul 5, 2025, 5:27 p.m. Bitcoin Cash retreats from eight-month high amid rising whale transactions What to know : Bitcoin Cash rose 75% over the past 90 days, hitting $526.5 on July 1 before retreating below $485. IntoTheBlock recorded a 122% surge in whale transactions on July 4, totaling $482 million. A golden cross on the hourly chart points to continued bullish momentum even as network usage hits a six-year low. Bitcoin Cash BCH $ 496.62 traded at $482.54 on July 5, down 0.23% over the past 24 hours, following a broader retreat from its recent multi-month high, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. As for the broader crypto sector as gauged by the CoinDesk20 Index (CD20) , it is up 0.27% during the same period. On July 1, BCH reached $526.5 — its highest price in eight months — as market enthusiasm, whale accumulation, and speculative inflows helped propel the token more than 75% higher over the past three months. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story.  today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  and  . The surge, briefly taking BCH above $528, coincided with a substantial increase in daily trading volume, which tripled to over 120,000 tokens exchanged within a 24-hour span. Much of the buying interest was attributed to capital rotation into mid-cap cryptocurrencies, as investors sought gains beyond the majors during a period of broader crypto market strength. On-chain fundamentals, however, remain lackluster. Daily active BCH addresses have dropped to a six-year low, suggesting that the rally is being driven more by speculation than by increased network utility. Despite this disconnect, technical indicators point to further upside potential. In late June, a golden cross formation appeared on BCH’s hourly chart—where the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day MA—a historically bullish signal. Adding to the speculative momentum, open interest in BCH derivatives rose 27.4% this past week to $578 million. Analysts are watching the $478 to $508 range closely, viewing it as a key support zone that could stabilize the current pullback. On July 4, analytics firm IntoTheBlock reported a 122.45% increase in large whale transactions involving over $100,000 in BCH, totaling 957,440 tokens worth approximately $482 million. This sharp rise in high-value transfers echoed earlier activity spikes seen in February, May, and late June—all of which preceded major price movements. A separate development on July 5 raised further intrigue, when a 10,000-BCH transaction worth roughly $5 million was flagged just prior to the historic movement of 80,000 dormant BTC — valued at over $8.5 billion. Experts suggest the BCH transfer may have served as a key test of wallet access before executing the massive Bitcoin transaction, which was the largest of its kind in over a decade. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin Cash Foundation published its July 1 update highlighting the release of Knuth v0.68.0, which unifies the node’s codebase and lays the groundwork for future UTXO efficiency upgrades. While no major adoption headlines emerged this week, smaller community projects continue to explore BCH-based micropayments and NFTs. Roger Ver, a longtime proponent of Bitcoin Cash, remains publicly active in promoting BCH as a scalable alternative to bitcoin, though his recent advocacy has not been accompanied by any new institutional product launches. Technical Analysis Highlights BCH traded within a $7.52 (1.57%) range between $481.83 and $489.35 from July 4 15:00 to July 5 14:00. Strong support was observed at $481.83 with elevated volume during the 04:00 hour on July 5. Resistance formed at $489.43, where repeated selling pressure capped gains. From 13:06 to 14:05 UTC on July 5, BCH gained $1.20 (0.25%) , briefly breaking above $483.25 on rising volume. Support in the final minutes of the session formed between $483.35 and $483.45, with price peaking at $483.81 during the 14:03 candle. isclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards .

By Omkar Godbole Updated Jul 5, 2025, 5:26 p.m. Published Jul 5, 2025, 5:18 p.m. New York. (Witizia/Pixabay) What to know : U.S. exceptionalism is evident in the stock market as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have outpaced global peers since early April. Economic indicators like real per capita GDP growth support the narrative of U.S. exceptionalism. The resurgence of U.S. exceptionalism may positively impact bitcoin and stabilize the U.S. dollar. U.S. exceptionalism, the notion that the U.S. economy and its financial markets are distinct compared to those of other nations, remains alive and well, at least according to the equity markets. Since the early April slide, Wall Street's tech-heavy Nasdaq index has surged 31%, while the broader S&P 500 index has rallied 24%, according to data source TradingView. Other major indices, such as Germany's DAX, France's CAC, Japan's Nikkei, and China's Shanghai Composite, have lagged behind Wall Street. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story.  today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  and  . Both Nasdaq and the S&P 500 traded at record highs Thursday. Demand for U.S. Treasury notes has held up amid concerns about fiscal sustainability, as noted by CoinDesk last month. The data contradicts the popular narrative that capital flows are rebalancing away from the U.S. en masse due to debt jitters and President Donald Trump's trade war and repeated criticism of the Federal Reserve. \"Several key factors that underpinned U.S. exceptionalism remain fully intact and are perhaps even strengthening further,\" Hani Redha, portfolio manager, head of strategy and research for global multi-asset at PineBridge Investments, wrote in a blog post published last month. Redha pointed to deregulation under Trump as a key factor supporting the US’s productivity supercycle – unique among global peers – and its lead globally. Economy validates U.S. exceptionalism Other economic variables, such as the real per capita GDP growth, also support the exceptionalism narrative. The metric measures the rate at which the value of goods and services produced per person in an economy is adjusted for inflation. \"The U.S. massively outperforms the EU in terms of real per capita GDP growth. The reasons for that are deeply structural and haven't changed one bit. U.S. exceptionalism - for growth at least - is here to stay...,\" Robin Brooks, senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution, said on X . The U.S. jobs data released Thursday further added another stake in the ‘loss of American exceptionalism narrative, as Bruce J Clark, head of rates at Informa Global Markets, said on LinkedIn. Implications for BTC and DXY The return of U.S. exceptionalism to U.S. stocks can be viewed as a positive development for bitcoin BTC $ 109,050.61 and the broader crypto market, given the historical positive correlation between the two. BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has already risen 44% to $108,000, rallying swiftly from the early April lows of nearly $75,000, according to CoinDesk data. Moreover, with the pro-crypto president in the White House, one may argue that bitcoin is part of the U.S. exceptionalism play. Meanwhile, the return of U.S. exceptionalism could also put a floor under the U.S. dollar. \"With today’s jobs data putting another stake in the ‘loss of American exceptionalism’ narrative, the temptation to get long dollars here for a counter-trend trade is big and growing,\" Clark noted , adding the ECB officials' growing discomfort with the strong euro. Early this week, the FT reported , quoting a senior ECB official, that the central bank may need to signal that too much strengthening in the euro could be an issue, as it might lead inflation to hover below targets. Meanwhile, in an interview with Bloomberg, ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said that \"overshooting\" of the euro should be avoided, flagging levels above 1.20 as complicated.

By Francisco Rodrigues , AI Boost | Edited by Aoyon Ashraf Jul 5, 2025, 4:57 p.m. (Charito Yap/Flickr) What to know : Drake referenced bitcoin’s price swings in his latest song, “What Did I Miss,” tying crypto chaos to friendships. The rapper has famously wagered millions in BTC on sports via the crypto gambling site Stake. His crypto ventures include a $100M Stake deal and investments in firms including MoonPay. Drake’s latest track, “What Did I Miss,” features lyrics about betrayal, luxury, and bitcoin. The rapper compares fickle friends to the cryptocurrency’s rollercoaster price moves, saying he looked at it “like a BTC”: “Could be down this week, then I’m up next week.” It’s not the first time bitcoin has appeared in Drake’s orbit. In the past few years, the Canadian superstar has become one of crypto’s most visible celebrity community members. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story.  today .

The rapper shared a clip of Michael Saylor on his Instagram account, which at the time had over 146 million followers, where Strategy’s co-founder said bitcoin would “eat” gold. He’s also dropped more than $1 million worth of bitcoin on losing bets for the Dallas Mavericks and Edmonton Oilers, with other high-profile punts on UFC fights and Formula One races. Drake’s betting performance has inspired memes calling it the “Drake Curse,” referencing losses in the teams and athletes he bets on. The rapper addressed that curse, telling fans he’s just a “flawed sports bettor.” Yet Drake isn’t just rolling dice. He has partnered with crypto gambling platform Stake, in a partnership that’s reported to be worth $100 million annually. Outside the casino lights, Drake has made crypto investments in firms, including MoonPay and brandished hardware wallets on social media. Interestingly, Drake’s nod to bitcoin’s volatility comes at a time that’s being interpreted as the calm before the storm. Deribit’s bitcoin volatility index ( DVOL ) has, in fact, dropped to a near two-year low at 38.

By Siamak Masnavi , CD Analytics | Edited by Aoyon Ashraf Updated Jul 5, 2025, 4:57 p.m. Published Jul 5, 2025, 4:41 p.m. FLOKI shows strong morning rally followed by profit-taking on July 5 What to know : FLOKI launched Valhalla mainnet on opBNB, expanding its blockchain gaming ecosystem.

FLOKI FLOKI $ 0.0₄8728 traded near $0.00007417 on July 5, up 1.32% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. As for the broader memecoin sector as gauged by the CoinDesk Memecoin Index (CDMEME) , it is up 1.79% during the same period.

But the launch of the Valhalla mainnet marks its most ambitious gaming milestone to date. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story.  today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  and  . On June 30, 2025, FLOKI officially launched V alhalla , a blockchain-based game inspired by Norse mythology. The game runs on opBNB , a Layer-2 network designed to enable fast and inexpensive transactions. Players take control of Veras — customizable NFT characters — in a browser-based, turn-based tactical MMORPG that blends combat, exploration, and questing with blockchain-backed rewards. The play-to-earn economy is built around FLOKI tokens, which players earn by completing in-game tasks and winning battles. To support the game’s rollout, the FLOKI team has committed millions of dollars from its treasury to fund development, marketing campaigns, and in-game incentives. That long-term investment signals the project’s intention to build a sustainable blockchain gaming ecosystem rather than a short-term promotional play. And on June 27, FLOKI announced a partnership with Method , a well-known esports organization recognized for its World of Warcraft dominance. Method will serve as a strategic content partner, producing onboarding materials, game guides, and live coverage to help Valhalla appeal to both traditional gamers and crypto-native audiences. The partnership will include branded jerseys and appearances in gaming tournaments throughout 2025 and 2026, designed to grow Valhalla’s player base and community awareness. These developments represent a pivotal moment in FLOKI’s evolution, as the project attempts to move beyond its meme origins and establish itself at the intersection of Web3 technology, entertainment, and digital asset ownership.
