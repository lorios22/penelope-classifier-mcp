Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. Listen 0:00 656 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Today, in crypto, TON launched the UAE Golden Visa program, which requires just $100,000 in staked TON, though the program’s validity was questioned by former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao. Meanwhile, Arkham said the recent $8.6 billion Bitcoin whale transfer doesn’t look like it is being sold off, and musical artist Drake mentioned BTC in a new song. TON offers 10-year UAE golden visa for $100K in staked Toncoin The Open Network (TON), the blockchain platform spun out of Telegram, has unveiled a new pathway to UAE residency, offering 10-year Golden Visas to applicants who stake $100,000 worth of Toncoin (TON) for three years and pay a one-time $35,000 processing fee. “Secure your Golden Visa in under 7 weeks from document submission to the Visa Office,” TON announced Saturday, detailing that its UAE-based partners will manage the visa processing and residency status confirmation. Applicants retain control of their assets during the staking period through a decentralized smart contract verifiable on the TON blockchain. Furthermore, the program promises estimated annual yields of 3% to 4% on staked assets, adding an incentive for crypto investors. The Golden Visa extends coverage to immediate family members, including spouses, children, and parents, at no additional cost beyond standard government fees. However, former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao questioned the program’s legitimacy , pointing out the lack of official government announcements. “It would be awesome IF it is true. But I got conflicting info so far,” CZ said, adding that there is “no official gov website” with any update about the Golden Visa offer. Source: TON $8.6B Bitcoin whale transfer shows no signs of sell-off: Arkham Blockchain intelligence firm Arkham says the recent $8.6 billion in Bitcoin that was moved on Thursday for the first time in over 14 years doesn’t appear to be heading for a sell-off. “There are no indications that this whale is selling Bitcoin,” Arkham said in an X post on Friday. Arkham firm added that the eight transfers — which moved 10,000 Bitcoin at a time from eight wallets that were untouched for over 14 years — may be possibly due to the owner upgrading from the original legacy wallet to a Native SegWit address, which are said to have improved security and lower fees. “Yesterday’s $8 billion transfers were possibly related to address upgrades, moving from 1-addresses to bc1q-addresses,” Arkham said. Drake drops Bitcoin reference in new song Musical artist Drake mentioned Bitcoin ( BTC ) in his latest song \"What Did I Miss?\" The song was released on Saturday and is already drawing attention from Bitcoiners on social media. Drake previously bet $1 million in BTC on the outcome of the 2022 Super Bowl; the championship game of the American contact sport. The specific verse from the song goes: \"I look at this shit like a BTC, could be down this week, then I'm up next week. I don't give a fuck if you love me. I don't give a fuck if you like me. Askin' me 'How did it feel?' Can't say it didn't surprise me.\" Pop culture references to Bitcoin indicate that the digital asset is gradually shifting from a niche phenomenon into the mainstream. Despite growing adoption, Bitcoin still remains well below its total addressable market.

Listen 0:00 1070 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has questioned the legitimacy of The Open Network’s new pathway to UAE residency, noting the absence of any official announcement from UAE government sources. As Cointelegraph reported , The Open Network announced on Saturday that 10-year UAE Golden Visas will be available to applicants who stake at least $100,000 worth of Toncoin (TON) for three years and pay a $35,000 processing fee. The visa could reportedly be secured in under seven weeks. “Is this real?” CZ asked on X in response to the announcement. “It would be awesome IF it is true. But I got conflicting info so far.” “There are no official gov website with the “stake Ton for golden visa” update,” CZ added, noting the lack of information about which government entity, if any, approved the program. Source: CZ CZ is familiar with the UAE’s residency requirements, having received a Golden Visa when he first arrived in the country. In response to CZ’s post, some X users pointed out that Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has confirmed the news. Durov reposted the announcement on X from crypto influencer Ash Crypto. Even so, CZ had reservations, stating he likes to “trust but verify.” Source: CZ Nevertheless, the announcement was enough to send TON’s price sharply higher, with the token rallying more than 11% within a few hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Cointelegraph could not independently verify the news, as the announcement did not appear on the websites of the Ras Al Khaimah Emirate DAO, Securities and Commodities Authority, Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority or Abu Dhabi Global Market Authority as of Sunday afternoon. However, as the original announcement stated, the Golden Visa program is being managed by a third party. “Our visa issuing partner in the UAE will review your details and guide you through the final steps,” TON said.

Many of these advantages were highlighted at the recent Token2049 conference in Dubai, which CZ attended . As Cointelegraph recently reported , the UAE has launched a Machine Economy Free Zone to explore the intersection of robotics, AI and decentralization. The new sandbox, developed in partnership with layer-1 blockchain peaq, aims to reward tokenholders with a share of the revenues generated by machine economy activities. The initiative also seeks to create real-world use cases for decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) networks. The UAE has also positioned itself as a key player in tokenized real estate , with Dubai launching the first licensed tokenized real estate project in the Middle East and North Africa. The initiative is a collaboration between the Central Bank of the UAE, the Dubai Futures Foundation and the Dubai Land Department. In May, a $3 billion real estate blockchain deal contributed to a surge in Dubai property sales.

Listen 0:00 1398 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Venture capital funding in the crypto industry has shown signs of stagnation in recent months, with some firms struggling to close new funds — a trend highlighted by Sarah Austin, co-founder of the real-world asset (RWA) platform Titled, which raised a $1.3 million seed round earlier this year. Despite this challenging macro environment, “Blockchain infrastructure remains the lead story in the crypto space,” said Kaden Stadelmann, chief technology officer at Komodo Platform. He noted that the key crypto themes still attracting investment include AI, decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) , tokenization, payments and RWAs. In June, several high-profile funding deals reflected this continued interest, with decentralized finance (DeFi), trading platforms, pre-seed growth funds and projects at the intersection of digital assets and artificial intelligence all securing capital. The latest VC Roundup takes a deeper look at these deals against a backdrop of seasonal volatility that could limit dealmaking in the near term. Kraken-backed Rails goes live following $20M funding Cryptocurrency exchange Rails has revealed $20 million in venture funding across two rounds, with the most recent completed in April. The company is building a trading platform that aims to combine the utility of centralized exchanges with the advantages of decentralized markets. Rails is backed by crypto exchange Kraken, venture capital firm Slow Ventures, blockchain security firm Quantstamp and others. Slow Ventures described Rails as a “hybrid perpetual exchange that gives professional traders the speed of a CEX without giving up custody.” Source: Slow Ventures Castle Ventures leads $7M Beam fundraise Stablecoin payment service provider Beam has closed a $7 million funding round to expand its compliance efforts and network capabilities, aiming to further bridge the gap between digital assets and traditional finance. The round was led by Castle Ventures, with additional participation from Bankless Ventures, Archetype, Arca, Verda Ventures and others. Beam offers stablecoin payment rails for fintechs, banks and consumer platforms, and is already live on Visa Direct, Mastercard Send and the Federal Reserve’s FedNow system . With this latest raise, Beam’s total funding now stands at $14 million. The company plans to use the new capital to expand operations in Latin America, Africa, Asia-Pacific and the European Union. The total stablecoin market has eclipsed $250 billion.

The fund will support startup founders building decentralized AI, infrastructure and consumer applications. Frachtis has already backed eight projects at the pre-seed and seed stages, spanning DeFi and AI protocols. Meegan said he’s drawing on his experience at Chorus One — where he led more than 40 investments — to identify the next major use cases in blockchain. Interface Labs gets funding to build a cryptographic trust layer for AI agents Web3 developer Inference Labs has raised $6.3 million to build a cryptographic trust layer for AI agents — an area the company describes as underdeveloped, especially in light of the recent growth in artificial intelligence tools. The funding round included backing from DACM, Delphi Ventures, Arche Capital and Lvna Capital. Inference Labs is developing Proof of Inference, a cryptographic method that validates AI outputs using zero-knowledge proofs . Zero-knowledge technology has gained traction within the crypto ecosystem for its ability to ensure the safety and privacy of transactions. With the new funding, Inference Labs has launched a testnet for its Proof of Inference, featuring integrations with EigenLayer and Bittensor . The mainnet launch is planned for the third quarter of this year. Pantera Capital, Multicoin Capital lead Gradient Network seed round Gradient Network, a company developing a decentralized AI runtime on Solana, has secured $10 million in seed funding from Pantera, Multicoin Capital and HSG. The funding will support the expansion of Gradient’s decentralized AI infrastructure, with one of its core protocols, Lattica, launching in June. Gradient is also building Parallax, a decentralized inference engine designed to scale large language models and other AI applications. A Gradient Network spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the company’s choice to build on Solana was a key factor in attracting investment from Pantera and Multicoin Capital.

Yupp is developing a platform where users can compare outputs from leading AI models — including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Llama and others — and earn cryptocurrency rewards for their evaluations. The platform integrates payment services from Coinbase, Stripe, and PayPal. The a16z team described Yupp as transforming “human judgment into a renewable economic resource.” DeFi solutions architect Blueprint Finance raises $9.5M Blueprint Finance, a multichain DeFi infrastructure developer, has raised an additional $9.5 million to expand its product suite, following the launch of its Ethereum-based yield platform, Concrete, and Solana-based trading and staking platform, Glow Finance. The funding round was led by Polychain Capital, with participation from Yzi Labs, VanEck, Bitpanda Ventures, BitGo, Gate Ventures and others. The raise comes as the DeFi sector recovers from the 2022 bear market. While total value locked (TVL) across DeFi platforms has rebounded significantly from its lows, it still remains below the sector’s all-time high three years ago. When measured by TVL, the DeFi sector peaked in 2022.

    "content": "Dominic Schwenter 6 hours ago Crypto adoption will be driven by high-growth markets, with or without the US Crypto adoption is rapidly growing in high-growth markets, where the technology is solving real-world problems, like remittances, financial inclusion and supply chain inefficiencies. Listen 0:00 1506 Opinion COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Opinion by: Dominic Schwenter, chief operating officer of Lisk The US is in the middle of a crypto boom. Exchange-traded fund approvals have opened the door to institutional adoption, liquidity is increasing and regulatory clarity is beginning to take shape under a more crypto-aligned administration. Filings from the Securities and Exchange Commission referencing blockchain hit an all-time high in February 2025, signaling a broader shift in how seriously the technology is being taken at the highest levels. This momentum is good for the industry. US-based crypto companies have spent nearly a decade building through regulatory uncertainty, and they deserve the attention and rewards that are finally arriving. Is institutional support finally showing up? It’s overdue — and well-earned. Zooming in on the US too much, however, puts the industry at risk of missing what’s happening elsewhere. Some of the most important crypto adoption today takes root in places far outside the spotlight. The most exciting crypto adoption isn’t happening on Wall Street. It is unfolding in high-growth markets where people use crypto not to speculate but out of necessity. These communities didn’t wait for headlines. They built through every cycle and are now setting the pace for where Web3 is going next. High-growth markets are leading in adoption Fifteen of the top 20 countries on Chainalysis’s 2024 Global Crypto Adoption Index are in high-growth regions such as Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Nigeria. These aren’t just speculative hotspots. In many of these countries, crypto is part of daily life. Unlike boom-and-bust markets, adoption here hasn’t wavered. It is grounded in utility. In many of these economies, crypto helps families facilitate remittances, offers a safer way to store value when local currencies aren’t stable and lets small businesses move money without friction. In the West, crypto still carries the sheen of a high-risk investment. In high-growth markets, it’s already embedded into daily life. That’s what real adoption looks like. Builders are shifting to high-growth markets As steady, practical usage rises, builder activity follows. Currently, the global developer map is changing fast. According to the 2024 Electric Capital Developer Report, Asia now accounts for 32% of active crypto developers — a massive jump from just 12% in 2015. Over the same period, the US’s share dropped sharply, to 19% from 38%. The blockchain talent pool isn’t shrinking; it’s moving to where the momentum is. Additionally, 41% of all new crypto developers now come from Asia, illustrating a growing pipeline of builders emerging outside of traditional tech hubs. These aren’t just hobbyists but the next wave of founders, architects and engineers choosing to build closer to the problems crypto can solve. Related: Xend Finance, Risevest launch tokenized stocks platform in Africa This shift isn’t limited to Central Asia. Africa, South America and Southeast Asia are all seeing steady increases in developer activity, while North America and Europe continue to decline in relative share. The message is clear: Web3 innovation is no longer anchored to a single geography. It’s driven by builders who are closer to real-world needs — and who are designing for them. Blockchain solving real problems The surge in developer activity and adoption across high-growth markets isn’t happening in a vacuum. Instead, it’s tied to real-world effects. For example, nine of South Africa’s largest food and beverage wholesalers have partnered with LovCash, a blockchain-powered end-to-end digital payments platform, to digitize the country’s informal trade economy. In just five months, over 3,700 mom-and-pop shops have joined the platform, a rapid shift toward a more connected, cashless ecosystem. Blockchain is serving as a trusted tech infrastructure for South Africa’s informal supply chain. In regions where traditional infrastructure is often fragmented or absent, LovCash enables seamless, cashless transactions between small, often unbanked retailers and wholesalers. Beyond simplifying payments, the system provides wholesalers with real-time insights into sales trends and product demand, enabling smarter planning and reducing waste. There’s no token speculation here, no flashy NFTs; just a real-world solution to a real-world supply chain challenge. A call to action for Web3 builders What’s happening in the US is worthy of celebration, but it’s not the whole story. Real-world adoption, momentum from builders and real use cases are accelerating in high-growth markets, where crypto is already making a difference. This is where Web3’s long-term effect will be shaped. Builders and investors should stop waiting for validation from Washington or Wall Street and start paying attention to the places where the tech is solving real problems right now. Crypto didn’t wait for the US to matter. If the goal is to build something truly global, it’s time to follow the people already using it to make things work.

BTC price and SOL price targets are $230,000 and $4,390, respectively. SOL/USD would need to deliver gains of nearly 3,000% to hit the breakout top level. Bitcoin ( BTC ) can reach $230,000 if a classic breakout move completes successfully, a new prediction states.

Solana “waiting” for breakout with $4,390 target Bitcoin has spent seven weeks acting within a narrow range , but as time goes on, anticipation is growing as to where BTC price action will head next. For Trader Alan, a familiar chart pattern holds the key — and so far, progress is exactly what bulls are hoping for. “Bitcoin and Solana Cup and Handle Pattern on monthly chart,” he told X followers, adding that SOL/USD is currently attempting to copy BTC. A cup-and-handle pattern is a well-known bullish setup in which price returns to a previous high, consolidates and then continues higher, often with explosive results. As Cointelegraph reported , BTC/USD has already completed a long-term cup and handle, from its 2021 peak to 2022 low and back up, followed by its first trip to the $100,000 mark. “$BTC has broken out the handle while $SOL is still waiting for the breakout,” Alan claims about the latest iterations of the pattern, which in Bitcoin’s case extends the breakout beyond the 2021 high. “This pattern sets $BTC and $SOL to targets of $230,000 and $4,390 respectively.” BTC/USD vs. SOL/USD comparison.

    "content": "Amin Haqshanas 8 hours ago Vitalik proposes gas cap to enhance Ethereum security, stability Vitalik Buterin proposes EIP-7983 to cap transaction gas at 16.77 million, aiming to boost Ethereum security, stability, and zkVM compatibility. Listen 0:00 4882 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and researcher Toni Wahrstätter have put forward EIP-7983, which aims to introduce a protocol-level cap on transaction gas usage to increase network security and performance. The proposal sets a maximum gas limit of 16.77 million (2²⁴) for individual transactions. “By implementing this limit, Ethereum can enhance its resilience against certain DoS vectors, improve network stability, and provide more predictability to transaction processing costs,” the proposal reads. Under the current Ethereum ( ETH ) architecture, a single transaction can theoretically consume the entire block’s gas limit, posing a risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and leading to unpredictable network behavior. By capping individual transactions, EIP-7983 seeks to distribute gas consumption more evenly, reducing the chance of single transactions overwhelming block capacity. Source: Cointelegraph Related: Vitalik Buterin’s vision for Ethereum: Pectra, Glamsterdam and beyond Gas cap to boost zkVM compatibility The proposed cap is also designed to improve compatibility with zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs) by encouraging large transactions to be split into smaller chunks. According to the draft, transactions specifying gas limits beyond 16.77 million would be rejected during block validation, ensuring they cannot enter the network or be included in new blocks. The cap is independent of the overall block gas limit, which miners and validators can still adjust within existing consensus rules. Buterin and Wahrstätter chose 16.77 million as the cap to balance complexity and performance, arguing it accommodates current advanced DeFi use cases and contract deployments without introducing unnecessary risks. “This value enables most current use cases including contract deployments and advanced DeFi interactions while ensuring consistent performance characteristics,” the proposal reads. While the proposal isn’t backward-compatible for transactions exceeding the new limit, the authors noted that most existing transactions fall well below the cap, minimizing the impact on users and developers. EIP-7983 builds on prior efforts, like EIP-7825, to improve predictability in transaction execution. Related: Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scaling Vitalik wants to make Ethereum simple In May, Buterin called for simplifying the Ethereum network’s base protocol to boost efficiency, security, and accessibility, inspired by Bitcoin’s minimalist approach. At the time, he proposed restructuring Ethereum’s architecture across consensus, execution, and shared components to achieve a leaner design within five years. Buterin argued that Ethereum’s growing complexity has led to longer development times, higher costs, and increased security risks. More recently, the Ethereum mastermind introduced a new kind of digital identity system dubbed “pluralistic identity,” arguing it could protect privacy while enabling fair participation in digital life.

By Siamak Masnavi , CD Analytics | Edited by Aoyon Ashraf Updated Jul 6, 2025, 6:00 p.m. Published Jul 6, 2025, 4:33 p.m. TON broke out early on July 6, reaching $3.06 before cooling to the $2.89 range by session close. What to know : TON Foundation has launched a UAE Golden Visa program requiring $100K toncoin staking plus a $35K fee, promising fast approval and family inclusion. The initiative claims to offer a capital-efficient alternative to traditional UAE residency routes but faces skepticism over official government backing. Following the announcement, toncoin’s price surged 12%, trading at $2.89 with 24-hour volume over 250% above its 30-day average. On July 6, Max Crown, CEO of the TON Foundation, announced on X a \"groundbreaking initiative\" offering toncoin TON $ 2.8524 holders the \"exclusive chance\" to secure a 10-year UAE Golden Visa. The program requires applicants to stake $100,000 worth of toncoin for three years and pay a one-time processing fee of $35,000. After the three-year lock-up period, staked funds can apparently be unlocked, and during this time, applicants reportedly earn an estimated 3–4% annual percentage yield (APY) on their staked tokens. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story.  today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  and  . The TON Foundation’s website highlights several key alleged benefits: fast approval within seven weeks from document submission, a simple process without the need to purchase real estate or meet income thresholds, and inclusion of family members — spouse, children, and parents — at no extra cost beyond standard government fees. The staking is conducted through decentralized smart contracts on the TON blockchain, which it argues ensures transparency and security. The program claims to offer a capital-efficient alternative to traditional UAE Golden Visa routes, which the TON Foundation says typically require a minimum investment of approximately $540,000 in real estate or fixed deposits, often tied to illiquid assets and longer processing times. The TON Golden Visa initiative is touted as a faster, more affordable, and digitally native pathway to UAE residency, aligning with the country’s ambition to become a global crypto and Web3 hub. The announcement had an immediate impact on toncoin’s market performance. Shortly after the news broke, toncoin’s price surged by 12%. At the time of writing, the token trades around $2.8944, reflecting a 5.36% increase over the past 24 hours. Additionally, the current 24-hour average trading volume is approximately 251.54% higher than the 30-day average, signaling heightened market interest and activity, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. Despite the enthusiasm, the announcement has generated controversy within the crypto community. Bobby Ong, co-founder and COO of CoinGecko, praised the partnership as an “amazing story” that could attract whales and provide strong buy support for toncoin, although he expressed hope that the initiative is not a temporary scheme. Conversely, \"Joe HedgedHog\" (\"@JoeHedgedHog\" on X) , an investment partner at Sigil Fund, pointed out that this is not an official UAE government partnership but rather a third-party legal firm using TON as a proxy to assist clients applying for the Golden Visa under the entrepreneur category. He noted that the firm could have used any cryptocurrency and that the staking requirement serves more as a token utility sink than a government mandate. Further skepticism came from \"ivangbi\" (\"@ivangbi_\" on X) , the Head of Strategy & Business Development at Gearbox Protocol, who described the announcement as misleading. According to this perspective, the legal firm receives the non-refundable $35,000 fee and attempts to submit applications to the UAE government, which ultimately decides on approval. He argued that the staked TON balance is only one of several requirements and may no longer be relevant under updated rules. He went on to say that the absence of blanket approval for TON stakers means that acceptance is uncertain, and the program may primarily serve as a marketing tool coupled with token utility. Changpeng Zhao (CZ) , co-founder and former CEO of Binance, expressed cautious interest in the TON Foundation’s UAE Golden Visa announcement but highlighted several uncertainties. He noted conflicting information about the program’s legitimacy, including claims that the $35,000 fee mainly goes to a legal agent rather than the government, and that the website’s language may misleadingly suggest a guaranteed visa upon staking $100,000 in toncoin. CZ also mentioned that theUAE regulators classify staking as a regulated activity for which TON may lack licenses. Importantly, he pointed out that official UAE government channels do not currently recognize staking toncoin as a visa qualification, listing the standard Golden Visa categories instead. In a follow-up post , CZ reiterated his cautious optimism, emphasizing the need to “trust but verify.” He acknowledged the potential benefits of such a program but stressed that official government partnerships and announcements are essential for legitimacy—none of which have yet been confirmed. His stance balances support for innovation and TON founder Pavel Durov with prudent skepticism about the program’s current status. The UAE entrepreneur visa category, which this program appears to target, is designed for individuals owning economic projects of a technical or innovative nature. Applicants must provide approval letters from an accredited UAE auditor confirming the project’s value (at least 500,000 AED) , local authorities verifying the project’s innovative character, and an accredited UAE business incubator to establish the proposed activity in the country. Technical Analysis Highlights Price surged from $2.75 to a peak of $3.06, representing an overall range of $0.34 (12.4%) . Rally began abruptly during the 7:00 hour on 6 July, when volume spiked to nearly 13 million. Extraordinary 57.5 million volume surge in the 8:00 hour propelled TON to its high. Support has formed around $2.86-$2.89 with high-volume buying. Resistance appears at $3.03, suggesting the token has established a new trading range. In the last 60 minutes from 6 July 15:12 to 16:11, TON experienced a significant price surge of 2.4%. Dramatic breakout occurred at 15:48 when volume spiked to 1.68 million tokens. Token reached a peak of $2.93 at 15:50 before establishing a new support level around $2.90-$2.91.

Bitcoin briefly topped $109,000, while XRP, Solana's SOL, and Dogecoin also saw significant gains. The U.S. is nearing several trade deals before the July 9 deadline, after which higher tariffs may be reinstated if negotiations fail. Major cryptocurrencies rose Sunday morning as the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted at upcoming trade deals before the July 9 Liberation Day tariff deadline. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, gained over 1%, briefly topping $109,000. Payments-focused XRP and Solana's SOL token gained over 2% each, with meme token dogecoin DOGE $ 0.1731 rising 3%, according to data source CoinDesk. Ethereum's ether, the second-largest token, rose 1.5% to $2,550. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story.  today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  and  . In an interview with CNN, Bessent stated that the U.S. is close to finalizing several trade deals ahead of the July 9 deadline, when the temporary pause in higher tariffs initially announced on April 2 is set to expire. \"President Trump's going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don't move things along, then on August 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level. So I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,\" Bessent said, per Reuters . Bessent explained that July 9 remains the deadline for negotiations, failing which higher tariffs, announced in early April, will take effect from Aug. 1. \"We are saying this is when it's happening. If you want to speed things up, have at it. If you want to go back to the old rate, that's your choice,\" Bessent told CNN, adding that some countries were 'foot-dragging' on getting to deals. Since taking office early this year, President Donald Trump has been focused on making the U.S. wealthy again by imposing tariffs on goods imported from other countries, a coercive tactic aimed at rebalancing trade relations and reducing the U.S. trade deficit. Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2, starting with a 10% base tax on all trading partners and additional amounts on many countries, with some ranging as high as 50%. The so-called Liberation Day announcement triggered a sell-off in financial markets, with U.S. stocks taking a significant hit alongside a sharp decline in bitcoin, which fell to $75,000. The panic likely prompted the Trump administration to announce a 90-day pause a week later. Since then, the so-called U.S. exceptionalism has resurfaced in financial markets, lifting major U.S. equity indices to record highs. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have outperformed their global peers, with BTC rallying to trade above $100,000.

Idle mempool suggests an impending crisis, according to one observer. One expert calls low activity evidence of a lack of retail participation in the bitcoin market. The Bitcoin blockchain lacks meaningful on-chain activity, even as its native token, bitcoin BTC $ 109,548.70 , trades near a record per-unit price. That's according to mempool – a holding area for unconfirmed blockchain transactions waiting to be included in a block by miners.

    "content": "Markets Share Share this article Copy link X icon X (Twitter) LinkedIn Facebook Email Chart of the Week: Wall Street Has Claimed Bitcoin—Now What? Bitcoin's correlation with U.S. equities is still very high, while it has almost zero relation to gold and USD. By Aoyon Ashraf | Edited by Francisco Rodrigues Jul 6, 2025, 1:00 p.m. Wall Street sign with American flags and New York Stock Exchange in Manhattan, New York City, USA. (Getty Images) What to know : Wall Street's influence has transformed bitcoin from an anti-establishment asset to a macro-driven risk asset. Bitcoin's correlation with U.S. equities has increased, challenging its status as a hedge or 'digital gold.' The market now views bitcoin similarly to traditional stocks, with its price influenced by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. \"Wall Street is coming for bitcoin.\" That phrase used to spark both hope and fear across crypto circles. Today, it's no longer a future threat or a bullish promise—it's just reality. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story.  today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  and  . The original premise of bitcoin (or crypto in general) —an asset that is censorship-resistant and doesn't answer to any traditional financial institution or government—is fading fast as Wall Street giants (as well as powerful political figures) continue to establish their strong foothold in the digital assets space. During the early years of the digital assets revolution, bitcoin was celebrated as uncorrelated and unapologetically anti-establishment. TradFi asset classes like S&P 500 would rise and fall—bitcoin didn't care. What bitcoin did care about were the flaws in the traditional financial system, which are still here to this day. A major example in BTC’s history that’s not-so-talked about anymore is the 2013 Cyprus banking crisis. The crisis, which occurred due to overexposure of banks to overleveraged local property companies and amid Europe’s debt crisis, saw deposits above 100,000 euros get a substantial haircut. In fact, 47.5% of uninsured deposits were seized. Bitcoin’s response was to move sharply upward to, for the first time in its history, cross the $1,000 threshold. After a prolonged bear market over the collapse of Mt. Gox , the idea of mass adoption grew, with Wall Street's entry into the sector seen as a stamp of validation for bitcoin as it meant more liquidity, mass adoption and price maturity. That changed everything. The price might have matured, as evidenced by waning volatility . But let’s face it—bitcoin is now just another macro-driven risk asset. \"Bitcoin, once celebrated for its low correlation to mainstream financial assets, has increasingly exhibited sensitivity to the same variables that drive equity markets over short time frames,\" said NYDIC Research in a report. In fact, the correlation is now hovering near the higher end of the historical range, according to NYDIG's calculations. \"Bitcoin’s correlation with U.S. equities remained elevated through the end of the quarter, closing at 0.48, a level near the higher end of its historical range.\" Bitcoin's correlation with S&P 500, gold and USD. (NYDIG Research) Simply put, when there is blood on the street (Wall Street that is) , bitcoin bleeds too. When Wall Street sneezes, bitcoin catches a cold. Even bitcoin's “digital gold” moniker is under pressure. NYDIG notes that bitcoin’s correlation to physical gold and the U.S. dollar is near zero. So much for the “hedge” argument—at least for now. Risk asset So why the shift? The answer is simple: to Wall Street, bitcoin is just another risk asset, not digital gold, which is synonymous with \"safe haven.\" Investors are repricing everything from central bank policy whiplash to geopolitical tension—digital assets included. \"This persistent correlation strength with U.S. equities can largely be attributed to a series of macroeconomic and geopolitical developments, the tariff turmoil and the rising number of global conflicts, which significantly influenced investor sentiment and asset repricing across markets,\" said NYDIG. And like it or not, this is here to stay—at least for a short to medium-term. As long as central bank policy, macro, and war-linked red headlines hit the tape, bitcoin will likely move in tandem with equities. \"The current correlation regime may persist as long as global risk sentiment, central bank policy, and geopolitical flashpoints remain dominant market narratives,\" NYDIG's report said. For the maxis and long-term holders, the original vision hasn't changed. Bitcoin's limited supply, borderless access, and decentralized nature remain untouched. Just don't expect them to impact price action just yet. For now, the market sees bitcoin as just another stock ticker. Just balance your trade strategies accordingly.

By Siamak Masnavi , CD Analytics | Edited by Aoyon Ashraf Jul 5, 2025, 9:40 p.m. ETH rebounds from support and consolidates near $2,515 on July 5, 2025 What to know : ETH is trading around $2,505, up 0.56% in the past 24 hours as bulls defend $2,500 support. SharpLink Gaming reaffirmed its Ethereum treasury strategy on July 4, and said Ethereum is becoming global finance’s foundational layer. The firm holds nearly 200K ETH and stakes its entire treasury across Ethereum-native protocols. At the time of writing, Ether ETH $ 2,594.18 is trading at around $2,505, up 0.56% in the past 24-hours, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. As for the broader crypto market as gauged by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) , it is up 0.34% during the same period. SharpLink Gaming, Inc. (SBET) is a pioneering online performance marketing company specializing in the sports betting and iGaming industries. Headquartered in Minneapolis, SharpLink leverages its AI-powered C4 platform to deliver personalized, data-driven marketing content that enhances customer acquisition and retention for sportsbook and casino operators. The company has expanded through strategic acquisitions and partnerships, establishing itself as a leader in the evolving sports betting ecosystem. On July 4, 2025, SharpLink announced on X that it has become the first publicly listed company to adopt ETH as its primary treasury reserve asset. The company outlined a comprehensive treasury strategy focused on accumulating ETH, staking it, and growing ETH-per-share to create long-term shareholder value.

SharpLink emphasized that its goal is not just to hold ETH but to actively deploy it through native staking, restaking, and Ethereum-based yield strategies. The company highlighted ETH's advantages as a corporate reserve asset: it is productive via staking rewards, composable across decentralized finance protocols, scarce, secure, and aligned with the infrastructure of the future internet. This approach represents a bold redefinition of traditional treasury management, integrating decentralized finance principles into corporate finance. This strategic pivot began with a $425 million private placement announced on May 27, led by Consensys and other prominent crypto investors, to fund the acquisition of ETH as SharpLink’s primary treasury asset. Joseph Lubin, Ethereum co-founder and founder of Consensys, joined SharpLink’s Board of Directors as Chairman upon closing this placement, reinforcing the company’s commitment to blockchain innovation. Since officially launching its ETH treasury strategy on June 2, SharpLink has aggressively expanded its Ethereum holdings. Between May 30 and June 12, 2025, the company acquired approximately 176,271 ETH for about $463 million at an average price of $2,626 per ETH. Following this, from June 16 to June 20, SharpLink purchased an additional 12,207 ETH for roughly $30.7 million, funded in part by $27.7 million raised through At-The-Market (ATM) equity sales. By June 24, SharpLink’s ETH holdings reached 188,478 ETH, with 100% of these reserves deployed in staking solutions generating staking rewards. And by July 1, the treasury expanded further to 198,478 ETH, yielding over 220 ETH in staking rewards since the strategy’s inception. Joseph Lubin has stated that embedding Ethereum at the core of SharpLink’s capital strategy embodies technological progress and institutional trust, positioning the company to lead the evolution of digital commerce. Meanwhile, CEO Rob Phythian has noted that SharpLink’s upcoming Nasdaq closing bell ceremony on July 7, 2025, will symbolize this new chapter, showcasing how digital assets can coexist with public market discipline and corporate governance. SharpLink’s Ethereum treasury strategy uniquely positions the company at the crossroads of sports betting, blockchain technology, and decentralized finance, offering investors regulated and transparent exposure to Ethereum’s growth potential while advancing SharpLink’s mission to innovate the multi-billion-dollar iGaming industry. Technical Analysis Highlights ETH gained 2.2% from July 4 15:00 to July 5 14:00, climbing from $2,475.48 to $2,530.02. A sharp sell-off between 13:06 and 14:05 pushed ETH down to $2,514.85 before buyers stepped in. Strong support formed between $2,480 and $2,500 during the July 5 16:00 hour, with 382,821 ETH traded. A bullish breakout on July 4 at 22:00 lifted ETH above $2,520, with resistance confirmed near $2,530. ETH consolidated around $2,515 with signs of reduced volatility and an ascending recovery trendline after 13:40. Momentum remains neutral short-term but structurally bullish given broader uptrend since late June.

    "content": "Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav Dmitri Mendeleev famously saw the complete arrangement of the periodic table after falling asleep on his desk. He claimed in his dream he saw a table where all the elements fell into place, and he wrote it all down when he woke up. By having a eureka moment right after a nap, he joined a club full of rather talented people: Mary Shelley, Thomas Edison, and Salvador Dali. To figure out if there’s a grain of truth to all these anecdotes, a team of German scientists at the Hamburg University, led by cognitive science researcher Anika T. Löwe, conducted an experiment designed to trigger such nap-following strokes of genius—and catch them in the act with EEG brain monitoring gear. And they kind of succeeded. Catching Edison’s cup “Thomas Edison had this technique where he held a cup or something like that when he was napping in his chair,” says Nicolas Schuck, a professor of cognitive science at the Hamburg University and senior author of the study. “When he fell asleep too deeply, the cup falling from his hand would wake him up—he was convinced that was the way to trigger these eureka moments.” While dozing off in a chair with a book or a cup doesn’t seem particularly radical, a number of cognitive scientists got serious about re-creating Edison’s approach to insights and testing it in their experiments. One of the recent such studies was done at Sorbonne University by Célia Lacaux, a cognitive neuroscientist, and her colleagues. Over 100 participants were presented with a mathematical problem and told it could be solved by applying two simple rules in a stepwise manner. However, there was also an undescribed shortcut that made reaching the solution much quicker. The goal was to see if participants would figure this shortcut out after an Edison-style nap. The scientists would check whether the eureka moment would show in EEG. Lacaux’s team also experimented with different objects the participants should hold while napping: spoons, steel spheres, stress balls, etc. It turned out Edison was right, and a cup was by far the best choice. It also turned out that most participants recognized there was a hidden rule after the falling cup woke them up. The nap was brief, only long enough to enter the light, non-REM N1 phase of sleep. Initially, Schuck’s team wanted to replicate the results of Lacaux’s study. They even bought the exact same make of cups, but the cups failed this time. “For us, it just didn’t work. People who fell asleep often didn’t drop these cups—I don’t know why,” Schuck says. The bigger surprise, however, was that the N1 phase sleep didn’t work either. Tracking the dots Schuck’s team set up an experiment that involved asking 90 participants to track dots on a screen in a series of trials, with a 20-minute-long nap in between. The dots were rather small, colored either purple or orange, placed in a circle, and they moved in one of two directions. The task for the participants was to determine the direction the dots were moving. That could range from easy to really hard, depending on the amount of jitter the team introduced. The insight the participants could discover was hidden in the color coding. After a few trials where the dots’ direction was random, the team introduced a change that tied the movement to the color: orange dots always moved in one direction, and the purple dots moved in the other. It was up to the participants to figure this out, either while awake or through a nap-induced insight. Those dots were the first difference between Schuck’s experiment and the Sorbonne study. Lacaux had her participants cracking a mathematical problem that relied on analytical skills. Schuck’s task was more about perceptiveness and out-of-the-box thinking. The second difference was that the cups failed to drop and wake participants up. Muscles usually relax more when sleep gets deeper, which is why most people drop whatever they’re holding either at the end of the N1 phase or at the onset of the N2 phase, when the body starts to lose voluntary motor control. “We didn’t really prevent people from reaching the N2 phase, and it turned out the participants who reached the N2 phase had eureka moments most often,” Schuck explains. Over 80 percent of people who reached the deeper, N2 phase of sleep found the color-coding solution. Participants who fell into a light N1 sleep had a 61 percent success rate; that dropped to just 55 percent in a group that stayed awake during their 20-minute nap time. In a control group that did the same task without a nap break, only 49 percent of participants figured out the hidden trick. The divergent results in Lacaux’s and Schuck’s experiments were puzzling, so the team looked at the EEG readouts, searching for features in the data that could predict eureka moments better than sleep phases alone. And they found something. The slope of genius The EEG signal in the human brain consists of low and high frequencies that can be plotted on a spectral slope. When we are awake, there are a lot of high-frequency signals, and this slope looks rather flat. During sleep, these high frequencies get muted, there are more low-frequency signals, and the slope gets steeper. Usually, the deeper we sleep, the steeper our EEG slope is. The team noticed that eureka moments seemed to be highly correlated with a steep EEG spectral slope—the steeper the slope, the more likely people were to get a breakthrough. In fact, the models based on the EEG signal alone predicted eureka moments better than predictions made based on sleep phases and even based on the sleep phases and EEG readouts combined. “Traditionally, people divided sleep EEG readouts down into discrete stages like N1 or N2, but as usual in biology, things in reality are not as discrete,” Schuck says. “They’re much more continuous, there’s kind of a gray zone.” He told Ars that looking specifically at the EEG trace may help us better understand what exactly happens in the brain when a sudden moments of insight arrives. But Shuck wants to get even more data in the future. “We’re currently running a study that’s been years in the making: We want to use both EEG and [functional magnetic resonance imaging] at the same time to see what happens in the brain when people are sleeping,” Schuck says. The addition of the fMRI imaging will enable Schuck and his colleagues to see which areas of the brain get activated during sleep. What the team wants to learn from combining EEG and fMRI imagery is how sleep boosts memory consolidation. “We also hope to get some insights, no pun intended, into the processes that play a role in generating insights,” Schuck adds.

In 2022, the company launched the StanbyME , which is essentially a $1,000 27-inch tablet running LG's smart TV operating system (OS), webOS, but lacking a tuner. LG's press release announcing the device described it as a “wireless private TV screen with a built-in battery” that is easily portable and ideal for watching shows and movies, in addition to “video conferencing with family and coworkers and viewing online lectures.” Today, the StanbyME competes against a slew of similar devices, including some from Samsung , but mostly from smaller brands and running Android. I've had one of these devices, the KTC MegPad 32-inch Android Tablet (A32Q7 Pro) , rolling around my home for a few weeks, and I'm left curious about what's driving the growth of StanbyME-like devices, which are noticeably niche and expensive. I'm also uncertain whether these hybrid devices have an ongoing place in a consumer tech world already inundated with big-screen TVs, small-screen tablets, and beloved laptops. Hands-on Unlike LG’s StanbyME, KTC’s device doesn’t run a smart TV OS. Instead, it’s a 32-inch Android 13 tablet. Still, KTC heavily markets the MegPad’s ability to serve as streaming hardware, and that’s one of the best uses I found for it. A big ol' tablet on wheels. Scharon Harding A big ol' tablet on wheels.

Scharon Harding Treating the MegPad like a smart TV on wheels meant I could have a living-room-like experience in more places throughout my home. I could watch TV in bed with a more visible screen set at a more comfortable distance than what I’d achieve with a laptop or tablet. It also meant flexibility. I don’t like having a permanent TV in my room (how would I ever get out of bed?), so I appreciated the ability to roll the MegPad out of my room or twist it so that the screen faced away from me. The MegPad is also a diplomatic solution for homes with limited TVs or computers. This could be helpful for homes with kids with varied interests or in my home, where a speedy, 55-inch TV in the living room is the best screen available by far. I was able to let my partner take the big screen for gaming and still hang out nearby while streaming on the MegPad. I don’t have a central coffee table in my living room, but the mobile tablet enabled me to watch shows without a device weighing down my lap or making me connect a wireless speaker for better volume. KTC's device also has a helpful leg-up over LG's StanbyME via its HDMI port, which makes the MegPad work like a regular monitor. Determining where to safely rest a device tethered to this mobile machine is something you'll have to figure out on your own, though. The port selection on the panel's backside.

Credit: Scharon Harding Compared to the TV mounted on my living room wall, the MegPad is much easier to move from room to room, but it’s easy to overestimate how seamless transporting it is. Yes, it's on a set of five 360-degree wheels, but the wheels don't lock, and the device weighs 40.3 pounds, per its Amazon listing . That means I had to exert a decent amount of effort to move it over floor transition strips, across uneven floors, and from hardwood to carpet.

Credit: Scharon Harding A fully rotating screen, however, makes up for some of my mobility complaints and diversifies the MegPad's potential uses. Besides streaming, for example, the MegPad was great for watching yoga videos online, (which calls for viewing the screen from different heights and positions). It also proved to be an ideal setup for creating a large, print-out collage, which included a lot of dragging, dropping, and cropping of images. How the MegPad moves.

But with TV and movie watching being some of the most obvious uses, it's important to note that neither the MegPad nor any of its rollable rivals are real TVs. For one, there's no tuner, though in the streaming world, that matters less to many of today’s TV viewers. Further, the MegPad, like many StanbyME-like devices, uses Android 13, which doesn't require paying vendor licensing fees like built-for smart TV OSes, such as Android TV/Google TV and webOS, would. There are some benefits to that, though. To start, Android 13 doesn’t have the integrated ads that Android TV or the Google TV interface does. Google claims that the Google TV platform doesn’t use automatic content recognition (ACR), but as Consumer Reports has noted, Google collects “data from TVs that use its smart TV platform—and there’s no opting out of Google’s policies during setup if you want smart TV functionality.” Further, Google may combine that data with user data from third parties for advertising purposes. A spokesperson for KTC confirmed to me that the MegPad doesn't use ACR. As a tablet, the MegPad is compatible with more apps, many of which aren't supported by Google TVs, like Google Sheets, Microsoft Word, Reddit, and Signal. Android tablets are also more appropriate for storing documents, photos, and other files than smart TVs are. Although it's likely less roomy than your PC, the MegPad has 128GB of internal storage. But since this is an Android tablet and not a Google TV, there are no integrated channels and no live-TV-only option, which stops the device from collecting diagnostic information. Google TV would also include a more streaming-friendly user interface and the ability to watch content from different streaming providers without switching apps. Further differing from LG's StanbyME and real TVs, the MegPad doesn't include a traditional remote. The tablet comes with a basic Bluetooth mouse, but due to the tablet's portability, I frequently used the tablet without a flat surface within arm’s reach available for comfortable mouse control. The touchscreen is reliable, but gestures can be cumbersome on a tablet this large, and the display was often out of my hand’s reach. The tablet comes with this mouse and removable mouse stand.

With TVs getting larger and people turning to portable gadgets like phones and laptops for TV watching, true portable TVs have become a rarity. Demand for a small device dedicated to on-the-go TV viewing has dropped significantly since the last century. Meanwhile, fabs and supply chains are built around monitor and TV-sized displays, making it difficult to incorporate some of the most desirable display technologies, like OLED, into smaller-sized panels with competitive prices. As a result, devices like the MegPad and Amazon's Echo Show have become the new de facto stand-ins for portable TVs, even though they're not true TV sets. Even LG's StanbyME Go , a 27-inch webOS-powered display packed into a briefcase, is a far cry from what most of us would traditionally consider a portable TV. LG's StanbyMe GO.

But they also require a reliance on Big Tech software and all the privacy and ethical implications that come with that. You don't see many of these anymore.

From left to right: Casio EV 570, Sony Watchman, and Casio EV 660. Credit: Richard Derk/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images KTC also sees the MegPad's appeal as a pseudo-TV. The MegPad's product page emphasizes users' ability to \"watch favorite shows/movies directly—no PC needed\" and to \"stream Netflix [and] YouTube... more effortlessly on your smart TV.\" Its Amazon product page also promotes the keywords \"portable TV,\" \"rolling TV,\" \"mobile TV,\" and \"standing TV.\" This is all despite the MegPad not technically being a true TV. \"KTC defines the MegPad A32Q7Pro as a portable, smart, touchscreen monitor,\" KTC's spokesperson told me. \"It combines key traits of a smart display and a large-screen tablet. While it shares some features with smart TVs, tablets, and monitors, it doesn't fully belong to any single traditional category. It's a hybrid device designed to bridge those use cases.\" Android tablets on wheels Many devices like the MegPad represent a push for more Android-powered, non-Google devices that has been buoyed by a program that Google launched in 2022, the Enterprise Devices Licensing Agreement (EDLA). As explained by partners like BenQ, EDLA is a way for third parties to incorporate Google Mobile Services (GMS), which are Google’s most commonly used apps and APIs bundled for use across different types of devices. GMS apps include popular software like Google Drive, Gmail, the Google Play Store, and YouTube. “Previously, GMS was only officially available for smartphones, tablets, TVs, and wearables. Under the new EDLA, the list of devices eligible for GMS certification has now been expanded to include enterprise solutions such as smart boards,” a blog from BenQ, which has EDLA-certified smart displays, reads. Since 2022, (the year LG's StanbyME launched), there has been an uptick in non-Google devices with this EDLA certification. One of the categories taking advantage of the newer program is tablets on wheels, like the MegPad and similar options from Kefeya , Apolosign , Innocn , and DuraPro . Demonstrating the marketing value of EDLA certification, the MegPad's product page reads: \"Google EDLA certification provides secure, direct access to Google services and the Google Play Store with regular updates, offering greater stability and data protection than open app ecosystems with unverified apps.\" Most EDLA-certified devices seem to be interactive displays used for education. With EDLA certification, devices like the MegPad may also draw the attention of educators or even businesses. Meanwhile, Google is happy to hand out EDLA certifications, as they can drive Android adoption, giving Google more data and access to customers outside of the typical Android devices, such as phones. Products like the MegPad can also be easier to shop with (Google loves when people use its offerings to shop) than Android devices with smaller screens. Who’s this for? I’ve been fascinated by the MegPad and similar devices because they introduce a unique approach to streaming, web browsing, and productivity. But ultimately, they’re hard to recommend when there are other personal gadgets that are more affordable and often take up less space. I had fun with the MegPad and appreciated the flexibility it offered, especially in my smaller NYC home. There are some specific use cases where products like this could excel, like if you want to bring a computer or screen into a room that doesn’t always need one. It was also helpful as an entertainment center for my father post-surgery, when he primarily had to lie on one side in bed. Overall, the growing presence of devices like the MegPad underscores a confluence occurring between smart TVs, tablets, monitors, and smart displays. With software being forced into more types of displays, often in the interest of gathering more user data, it’s an interesting time to consider what you want from your next screen—be it computing power, a certain size, the omission or inclusion of web connectivity, and mobility. It appears that the MegPad and similar tablets are trying to take advantage of the attention that LG garners when launching distinctive devices like its StanbyME line. Besides a StanbyME lookalike, Apolosign also makes a device similar to the StanbyME Go. Apolosign's PackGo is very similar to LG's StanbyME Go. Credit: Apolosign Three years after LG made TV-esque devices on wheels a talking point, more brands are trying to roll into the market. That includes LG’s best TV frenemy, Samsung , which has been using the form factor in limited geographies to drive sales of “smart monitors.\" Tech brands have ulterior motives for pushing this newer form factor that go beyond filling a gap in consumer gadgets. But if a large tablet or small smart display with wheels fits your needs, the options are there, and they should meet most expectations.

Today's edition will be a little shorter than normal because, for one day only, we celebrate fake rockets—fireworks—rather than the real thing. For our American readers, we hope you have a splendid Fourth of July holiday weekend. For our non-American readers, you may be wondering what the heck is happening in our country right now.

Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar. Will Orbex ever launch an orbital rocket ? Orbex, a launch services company based in the United Kingdom, has announced the postponement of its first orbital launch to 2026 due to infrastructure limitations and other issues, Orbital Today reports . At the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget, Orbex chief executive Miguel Bello Mora announced that the company is now targeting next year for the liftoff of its Prime rocket from SaxaVord in Scotland. He said the delay is partly due to the limited launch infrastructure at SaxaVord and a \"bottleneck\" in site operations. The real issue, revealed ... Orbex is developing the Prime rocket, but progress has been very slow. The company is now a decade old and has shown off relatively little hardware. It's difficult to believe the company will launch anytime soon. Tellingly, Orbex recently told the UK government it would need to raise a further 120 million pounds ($163 million) from private investors over the next four years to realize its ambitions. That seems like a huge ask. This newsletter has been skeptical of Orbex before, and this latest update only affirms that skepticism. Themis demonstrator arrives in Sweden . Developed by ArianeGroup, a 30-meter launch vehicle intended to demonstrate reusable launch capability has arrived at the Esrange Space Center in northern Sweden, SVT reports . The initial phase of the test campaign will include wet-dress rehearsals and hot-fire tests, to be followed by a \"hop test\" that will occur no earlier than the end of this year. Hopping higher and higher ... Based on experience from these initial tests, the program aims to fly the Themis demonstrator on higher and progressively more advanced tests, not dissimilar to what SpaceX did with its Grasshopper vehicle a little more than a decade ago in Texas. Eventually, Europe aims to use lessons learned from Themis to develop a reusable rocket similar to the Falcon 9 vehicle.

Rocket Lab's \"Symphony in the Stars\" mission lifted off on Saturday, June 28, from Mahia Peninsula in New Zealand. The mission was the second of two launches from the same launch site in less than 48 hours, a new record for turnaround time, the company said . It's a sign of a maturing company that Rocket Lab can turn between launches so quickly. Reaching an impressive cadence ... \"Symphony in the Stars\" was Rocket Lab’s tenth Electron mission of 2025 and its 68th launch overall as the company continues to increase the cadence of Electron launches. \"The future of space is built on proven performance, and Electron continues to deliver against a stacked launch manifest this year,\" Rocket Lab founder Peter Beck said in a news release. It's been a good year for the firm, with 100 percent mission success. Latitude announces expansion plans . In an emailed news release, the French launch startup Latitude said this week that it has secured a strategic industrial site south of Reims on the former AstraZeneca production facility. This site offers development potential of 270,000 sq. feet. By investing over 50 million euros ($58 million) in this site, Latitude aims to deliver on its promise of developing a small rocket with a high launch cadence. Seeking to scale ... \"Thanks to this location, we will be able to industrialize Zephyr production up to 50 units per year while maintaining control over our growth pace,\" said Isabelle Valentin, chief operating officer of the company. Latitude aims to launch its Zephyr rocket in 2026 from the Guiana Space Centre, in French Guiana, for the first time. The company also said it has signed two major contracts, including a strategic mission for the European Defence Fund and a contract with the French space agency, CNES, for microgravity demonstrations. Japan's H2A rocket makes final flight . Japan’s flagship H2A rocket lifted off for the final time on Sunday from the Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture, successfully concluding a 24-year run that has defined the nation’s space capabilities, The Japan Times reports . The rocket’s 50th and final mission carried the GOSAT-GW, a government-developed hybrid environmental observation satellite. Out with the old, in with the new ... Jointly developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, the 53-meter rocket debuted in 2001 and quickly became the workhorse of the country’s space program. It had an excellent record, with 49 successes out of 50 launch attempts. The decision to retire the H2A comes amid rising global competition in the space launch industry, where cost-efficiency has become a key differentiator. Japan hopes its new H3 rocket, although expendable, will be more cost competitive. SpaceX to win DOD satellite contract . The Trump administration plans to cancel a fleet of orbiting data relay satellites managed by the Space Development Agency and replace it with a secretive network that, so far, relies primarily on SpaceX's Starlink Internet constellation, Ars reports . While details of the Pentagon's plan remain secret, the White House proposal would commit $277 million in funding to kick off a new program called \"pLEO SATCOM\" or \"MILNET.\" The funding line for a proliferated low-Earth orbit satellite communications network hasn't appeared in a Pentagon budget before, but plans for MILNET already exist in a different form. X marks the spot ... Meanwhile, the budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 would eliminate funding for a new tranche of data relay satellites from the Space Development Agency. The pLEO SATCOM or MILNET program would replace them, providing crucial support for the Trump administration's proposed Golden Dome missile defense shield. While SpaceX's role isn't mentioned explicitly in the Pentagon's budget documents, the MILNET program is already on the books, and SpaceX is the lead contractor. It has been made public in recent months, after years of secrecy, although many details remain unclear. Prometheus rocket engine undergoes testing . European rocket builder ArianeGroup announced this week that it completed a series of Prometheus rocket engine test ignitions in late June, marking a key milestone in the program, European Spaceflight reports . Developed under a European Space Agency contract, Prometheus is a reusable rocket engine capable of producing around 100 metric tons of thrust. Launching soon from Sweden ... It is designed to be manufactured at a fraction of the cost of current European engines, with the use of additive manufacturing playing a key role in reducing production costs. According to ArianeGroup, the multiple ignitions over a single day represent a \"significant advancement in the engine’s development.\" Prometheus will initially power the Themis demonstrator (see item above). Its first commercial application will be the two-stage Maia rocket, developed by MaiaSpace, an ArianeGroup subsidiary. Do you want to buy SpaceX tokens ? SpaceX remains a privately held company, which means that us mere mortals cannot invest in the launch firm. (To be clear, as a space reporter, I do not invest in any space companies. To do so would be unethical.) The DealBook newsletter has a report on a new trend in \"tokens\" that allows ordinary investors to invest in privately traded companies, including SpaceX. Not technically equity ... Vlad Tenev, Robinhood’s chief executive, said that the tokens are not technically \"equity,\" but that they \"effectively give retail investors exposure to these private assets.\" Robinhood isn’t alone: The startup Republic is offering tokens meant to track the equity performance of SpaceX. Those will be sold to US investors via a loophole in a 2012 securities law. However, DealBook warns, unregulated private-company tokens could lead to a fragmented and less transparent ecosystem for investments, making it harder for regulators to protect the public. Texas politicians seek to move shuttle Discovery . This week, a political effort to relocate the space shuttle Discovery from the Smithsonian to Space Center Houston has been merged with the so-called \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" which the US Senate passed on Tuesday, Ars reports . Among the bill's many provisions is $85 million for the Bring the Space Shuttle Home Act. Sponsored by US Sen John Cornyn, R–Texas, the bill calls for Discovery to be removed from its home of the past 13 years, the National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, and put it on display at Space Center Houston, the official visitor complex for NASA's Johnson Space Center in Texas. Underestimating transport costs ... The Senate version of the bill provides \"no less than $5 million\" for the \"transportation of the space vehicle'' and the remainder to go toward the construction of a facility to house it. The original text of the Bring the Space Shuttle Home Act called for the NASA administrator and the Smithsonian to jointly develop a plan for moving Discovery prior to appropriations being made by Congress. It is unclear whether the total amount allocated by the Senate would be enough; the National Air and Space Museum provided Congress with an estimate of $200 million to $300 million for the move. Speaking frankly, and as a resident of Houston, this bill is absurd, and the shuttle Discovery absolutely belongs in the Smithsonian. NASA is being told to cut science missions left and right, but funding can be found for this? Next New Glenn launch will target Mars . Blue Origin is making steady progress toward the second launch of its New Glenn rocket, which could occur sometime this fall, Ars reports . Publicly, the company has said this second launch will take place no earlier than August 15. This is now off the table. One source told Ars that a mid- to late-September launch date was \"realistic,\" but another person said late October or November was more likely. A big landing on tap ... Blue Origin has been mum about the payload that will fly on this rocket, but multiple people have told Ars that the current plan is to launch NASA's ESCAPADE mission on the second launch of New Glenn. This mission encompasses a pair of small spacecraft that will be sent to Mars to study the red planet's magnetosphere. After ESCAPADE, Blue Origin has several missions tentatively plotted out. A much-anticipated mission to land Blue Origin's Mk1 lander on the Moon could take place during the first half of next year.

    "source": "Unknown Source",
    "content": "Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav The maker of a phone app that is advertised as providing a stealthy means for monitoring all activities on an Android device spilled email addresses, plain-text passwords, and other sensitive data belonging to 62,000 users, a researcher discovered recently. A security flaw in the app, branded Catwatchful, allowed researcher Eric Daigle to download a trove of sensitive data , which belonged to account holders who used the covert app to monitor phones. The leak, made possible by a SQL injection vulnerability, allowed anyone who exploited it to access the accounts and all data stored in them. Unstoppable Catwatchful creators emphasize the app's stealth and security. While the promoters claim the app is legal and intended for parents monitoring their children's online activities, the emphasis on stealth has raised concerns that it's being aimed at people with other agendas. \"Catwatchful is invisible,\" a page promoting the app says. \"It cannot be detected. It cannot be uninstalled. It cannot be stopped. It cannot be closed. Only you can access the information it collects.\" The promoters go on to say users \"can monitor a phone without [owners] knowing with mobile phone monitoring software. The app is invisible and undetectable on the phone. It works in a hidden and stealth mode.\" Daigle said the app does indeed stay hidden on devices as it uploads content in real time that can then be viewed from a web dashboard. The app, however, has a hidden backdoor that allows it to be uninstalled when a user inputs the numbers 543210 into the phone app keyboard, TechCrunch reported Wednesday. Daigel said other data spilled in the dump allowed him to identify the app operators and some of the online services they rely on. \"Dumping a stalkerware service’s database lets you do lots of fun things like identify who runs it and report it to various cloud providers who claim they’ll take it down,\" the researcher wrote. TechCrunch said that a web service hosting the app infrastructure terminated service after being contacted by the publication. Then, TechCrunch said, web host HostGator started hosting the infrastructure. Representatives of HostGator didn't immediately respond to questions about whether Catwatchful violates any of the host’s terms of service. Google has added new protections for Google Play Protect, its security tool for detecting malicious apps on Android phones, TechCrunch said. The protections will detect the Catwatchful spyware or its installer on a user’s phone.

    "title": "Judge: You can’t ban DEI grants without bothering to define DEI",
    "source": "Unknown Source",
    "content": "Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav In mid-June, a federal judge issued a stinging rebuke to the Trump administration, declaring that its decision to cancel the funding for many grants issued by the National Institutes of Health was illegal, and suggesting that the policy was likely animated by racism. But the detailed reasoning behind his decision wasn't released at the time. The written portion of the decision was finally issued on Wednesday, and it has a number of notable features. For starters, it's more limited in scope due to a pair of Supreme Court decisions that were issued in the intervening weeks. As a consequence, far fewer grants will see their funding restored. Regardless, the court continues to find that the government's actions were arbitrary and capricious, in part because the government never bothered to define the problems that would get a grant canceled. As a result, officials within the NIH simply canceled lists of grants they received from DOGE without bothering to examine their scientific merit, and then struggled to retroactively describe a policy that justified the actions afterward—a process that led several of them to resign. A more limited verdict The issue before Judge William Young of the District of Massachusetts was whether the government had followed the law in terminating grants funded by the National Institutes of Health. After a short trial, Young issued a verbal ruling that the government hadn't, and that he had concluded that its actions were the product of \"racial discrimination and discrimination against America’s LGBTQ. community.\" But the details of his decisions and the evidence that motivated them had to wait for a written ruling, which is now available. In the meantime, however, the Supreme Court had shifted the ground on a couple of issues. For example, while Young still feels that policy decisions were motivated by discrimination against the LGBTQ community, the United States v. Skrmetti decision limits what he can do about it. Young writes that the decision \"leads this Court to conclude that, while here there is federal government discrimination based on a person’s status, not all discrimination is pejorative.\" Separately, Trump v. Casa blocked the use of a national injunction against illegal activity. So, while the government's actions have been determined to be illegal, Young can only protect the people who were parties to this suit. Anyone who lost a grant but wasn't a member of any of the parties involved, or based in any of the states that sued, remains on their own. Those issues aside, the ruling largely focuses on whether the termination of grants violates the Administrative Procedures Act, which governs how the executive branch handles decision- and rule-making. Specifically, it requires that any decisions of this sort cannot be \"arbitrary and capricious.\" And, Young concludes that the government hasn't cleared that bar. Arbitrary and capricious The grant cancellations, Young concludes, \"Arise from the NIH’s newly minted war against undefined concepts of diversity, equity, and inclusion and gender identity, that has expanded to include vaccine hesitancy, COVID, influencing public opinion and climate change.\" The \"undefined\" aspect plays a key part in his reasoning. Referring to DEI, he writes, \"No one has ever defined it to this Court—and this Court has asked multiple times.\" It's not defined in Trump's executive order that launched the \"newly minted war,\" and Young found that administrators within the NIH issued multiple documents that attempted to define it, not all of which were consistent with each other, and in some cases seemed to use circular reasoning. He also noted that the officials who sent these memos had a tendency to resign shortly afterward, writing, \"it is not lost on the Court that oftentimes people vote with their feet.\" As a result, the NIH staff had no solid guidance for determining whether a given grant violated the new anti-DEI policy, or how that might be weighed against the scientific merit of the grant. So, how were they to identify which grants needed to be terminated? The evidence revealed at trial indicates that they didn't need to make those decisions; DOGE made them for the NIH. In one case, an NIH official approved a list of grants to terminate received from DOGE only two minutes after it showed up in his inbox. \"There is no reasoned decision-making at all with respect to the NIH’s 'abruptness' in the 'robotic rollout' of this grant-termination action,\" Young concludes. \"Based upon a fair preponderance of the evidence and on the sparse administrative record, the Court finds and rules that HHS and, in turn, NIH, are being force-fed unworkable 'policy' supported with sparse pseudo-reasoning, and wholly unsupported statements.\" Young also noted that the termination of grants to Columbia University was equally arbitrary. \"How the scientific and research activities had any connection with unrest issues on Columbia’s campus is conspicuously never explained,\" Young noted. \"The record evidence certainly reveals none.\" A small win against a larger loss Given all that, it's little surprise that the ruling declares the grant terminations to be arbitrary and capricious. \"The Public Officials [at the NIH] in their haste to appease the Executive, simply moved too fast and broke things,\" Young concluded, \"including the law.\" That provides the legal reasoning behind his earlier decision to restore the cancelled grants, although as noted, this has now been limited to only those grants held by researchers who are covered by one of the organizations or governments that filed the suit. But Young also appears to lament the fact that he had to intervene here, writing: The American people have enjoyed a historical norm of a largely apolitical scientific research agency supporting research in an elegant, merit-based approach that benefits everyone. That historical norm changed on January 20, 2025. The new Administration began weaponizing what should not be weaponized—the health of all Americans through its abuse of HHS and the NIH systems, creating chaos and promoting an unreasonable and unreasoned agenda of blacklisting certain topics, that on this Administrative Record, has absolutely nothing to do with the promotion of science or research. So, while the decision restores money to individual research programs, it does nothing to reverse the larger damage caused by the politicization of funding decisions.

    "content": "Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav In a memo to employees earlier this week , Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared a vision for a near-future in which \"personal [AI] superintelligence for everyone\" forms \"the beginning of a new era for humanity.\" The newly formed Meta Superintelligence Labs—freshly staffed with multiple high-level acquisitions from OpenAI and other AI companies—will spearhead the development of \"our next generation of models to get to the frontier in the next year or so,\" Zuckerberg wrote. Reading that memo, I couldn't help but think of another \"vision for the future\" Zuckerberg shared not that long ago. At his 2021 Facebook Connect keynote , Zuckerberg laid out his plan for the metaverse , a virtual place where “you're gonna be able to do almost anything you can imagine\" and which would form the basis of \"the next version of the Internet.\" \"The future of the Internet\" of the recent past. Credit: Meta \"The future of the Internet\" of the recent past. Credit: Meta Zuckerberg believed in that vision so much at the time that he abandoned the well-known Facebook corporate brand in favor of the new name \"Meta.\" \"I'm going to keep pushing and giving everything I've got to make this happen now,\" Zuckerberg said at the time. Less than four years later, Zuckerberg seems to now be “giving everything [he's] got\" for a vision of AI “superintelligence,\" reportedly offering pay packages of up to $300 million over four years to attract top talent from other AI companies (Meta has since denied those reports , saying, “The size and structure of these compensation packages have been misrepresented all over the place\"). Once again, Zuckerberg is promising that this new technology will revolutionize our lives and replace the ways we currently socialize and work on the Internet. But the utter failure (so far) of those over-the-top promises for the metaverse has us more than a little skeptical of how impactful Zuckerberg’s vision of “personal superintelligence for everyone\" will truly be. Meta-vision Looking back at Zuckerberg’s 2021 Facebook Connect keynote shows just how hard the company was selling the promise of the metaverse at the time. Zuckerberg said the metaverse would represent an “even more immersive and embodied Internet\" where “everything we do online today—connecting socially, entertainment, games, work—is going to be more natural and vivid.\" Mark Zuckerberg lays out his vision for the metaverse in 2021. \"Teleporting around the metaverse is going to be like clicking a link on the Internet,\" Zuckerberg promised, and metaverse users would probably switch between “a photorealistic avatar for work, a stylized one for hanging out, and maybe even a fantasy one for gaming.\" This kind of personalization would lead to “hundreds of thousands\" of artists being able to make a living selling virtual metaverse goods that could be embedded in virtual or real-world environments. “Lots of things that are physical today, like screens, will just be able to be holograms in the future,\" Zuckerberg promised. “You won't need a physical TV; it'll just be a one-dollar hologram from some high school kid halfway across the world… we'll be able to express ourselves in new joyful, completely immersive ways, and that's going to unlock a lot of amazing new experiences.\" A pre-rendered concept video showed metaverse users playing poker in a zero-gravity space station with robot avatars, then pausing briefly to appreciate some animated 3D art a friend had encountered on the street. Another video showed a young woman teleporting via metaverse avatar to virtually join a friend attending a live concert in Tokyo, then buying virtual merch from the concert at a metaverse afterparty from the comfort of her home. Yet another showed old men playing chess on a park bench, even though one of the players was sitting across the country. Meta-failure Fast forward to 2025, and the current reality of Zuckerberg’s metaverse efforts bears almost no resemblance to anything shown or discussed back in 2021. Even enthusiasts describe Meta’s Horizon Worlds as a “depressing\" and “lonely\" experience characterized by “completely empty\" venues. And Meta engineers anonymously gripe about metaverse tools that even employees actively avoid using and a messy codebase that was treated like “a 3D version of a mobile app. \" Even Meta employees reportedly don't want to work in Horizon Workrooms. Credit: Facebook Even Meta employees reportedly don't want to work in Horizon Workrooms. Credit: Facebook The creation of a $50 million creator fund seems to have failed to encourage peeved creators to give the metaverse another chance. Things look a bit better if you expand your view past Meta’s own metaverse sandbox; the chaotic world of VR Chat attracts tens of thousands of daily users on Steam alone , for instance. Still, we’re a far cry from the replacement for the mobile Internet that Zuckerberg once trumpeted. Then again, it’s possible that we just haven’t given Zuckerberg’s version of the metaverse enough time to develop. Back in 2021, he said that “a lot of this is going to be mainstream\" within “the next five or 10 years.\" That timeframe gives Meta at least a few more years to develop and release its long-teased, lightweight augmented reality glasses that the company showed off last year in the form of a prototype that reportedly still costs $10,000 per unit . Zuckerberg shows off prototype AR glasses that could change the way we think about \"the metaverse.\" Credit: Bloomberg / Contributor | Bloomberg Maybe those glasses will ignite widespread interest in the metaverse in a way that Meta’s bulky, niche VR goggles have utterly failed to. Regardless, after nearly four years and roughly $60 billion in VR-related losses , Meta thus far has surprisingly little to show for its massive investment in Zuckerberg’s metaverse vision. Our AI future? When I hear Zuckerberg talk about the promise of AI these days, it’s hard not to hear echoes of his monumental vision for the metaverse from 2021. If anything, Zuckerberg’s vision of our AI-powered future is even more grandiose than his view of the metaverse. As with the metaverse, Zuckerberg now sees AI forming a replacement for the current version of the Internet . “Do you think in five years we’re just going to be sitting in our feed and consuming media that's just video?\" Zuckerberg asked rhetorically in an April interview with Drawkesh Patel . “No, it's going to be interactive,\" he continued, envisioning something like Instagram Reels, but “you can talk to it, or interact with it, and it talks back, or it changes what it's doing. Or you can jump into it like a game and interact with it. That's all going to be AI.\" Mark Zuckerberg talks about all the ways superhuman AI is going to change our lives in the near future. As with the Metaverse, Zuckerberg sees AI as revolutionizing the way we interact with each other. He envisions “always-on video chats with the AI\" incorporating expressions and body language borrowed from the company’s work on the metaverse. And our relationships with AI models are “just going to get more intense as these AIs become more unique, more personable, more intelligent, more spontaneous, more funny, and so forth,\" Zuckerberg said. \"As the personalization loop kicks in and the AI starts to get to know you better and better, that will just be really compelling.\" Zuckerberg did allow that relationships with AI would “probably not\" replace in-person connections, because there are “things that are better about physical connections when you can have them.\" At the same time, he said, for the average American who has three friends, AI relationships can fill the “demand\" for “something like 15 friends\" without the effort of real-world socializing. “People just don't have as much connection as they want,\" Zuckerberg said. “They feel more alone a lot of the time than they would like.\" Why chat with real friends on Facebook when you can chat with AI avatars? Credit: Benj Edwards / Getty Images Why chat with real friends on Facebook when you can chat with AI avatars? Credit: Benj Edwards / Getty Images Zuckerberg also sees AI leading to a flourishing of human productivity and creativity in a way even his wildest metaverse imaginings couldn’t match. Zuckerberg said that AI advancement could “lead toward a world of abundance where everyone has these superhuman tools to create whatever they want.\" That means personal access to “a super powerful [virtual] software engineer\" and AIs that are “solving diseases, advancing science, developing new technology that makes our lives better.\" That will also mean that some companies will be able to get by with fewer employees before too long, Zuckerberg said. In customer service, for instance, “as AI gets better, you're going to get to a place where AI can handle a bunch of people's issues,\" he said. “Not all of them—maybe 10 years from now it can handle all of them—but thinking about a three- to five-year time horizon, it will be able to handle a bunch.“ In the longer term, Zuckerberg said, AIs will be integrated into our more casual pursuits as well. \"If everyone has these superhuman tools to create a ton of different stuff, you're going to get incredible diversity,\" and \"the amount of creativity that's going to be unlocked is going to be massive,\" he said. \"I would guess the world is going to get a lot funnier, weirder, and quirkier, the way that memes on the Internet have gotten over the last 10 years.\" Compare and contrast To be sure, there are some important differences between the past promise of the metaverse and the current promise of AI technology. Zuckerberg claims that a billion people use Meta’s AI products monthly, for instance, utterly dwarfing the highest estimates for regular use of “the metaverse\" or augmented reality as a whole (even if many AI users seem to balk at paying for regular use of AI tools). Meta coders are also reportedly already using AI coding tools regularly in a way they never did with Meta’s metaverse tools. And people are already developing what they consider meaningful relationships with AI personas, whether that’s in the form of therapists or romantic partners . Still, there are reasons to be skeptical about the future of AI when current models still routinely hallucinate basic facts , show fundamental issues when attempting reasoning , and struggle with basic tasks like beating a children’s video game . The path from where we are to a supposed “superhuman\" AI is not simple or inevitable, despite the handwaving of industry boosters like Zuckerberg. Artist's conception of Carmack's VR avatar waving goodbye to Meta. Artist's conception of Carmack's VR avatar waving goodbye to Meta. At the 2021 rollout of Meta’s push to develop a metaverse, high-ranking Meta executives like John Carmack were at least up front about the technical and product-development barriers that could get in the way of Zuckerberg’s vision. \"Everybody that wants to work on the metaverse talks about the limitless possibilities of it,\" Carmack said at the time (before departing the company in late 2022 ). \"But it's not limitless. It is a challenge to fit things in, but you can make smarter decisions about exactly what is important and then really optimize the heck out of things.\" Today, those kinds of voices of internal skepticism seem in short supply as Meta sets itself up to push AI in the same way it once backed the metaverse. Don’t be surprised, though, if today’s promise that we're at \"the beginning of a new era for humanity\" ages about as well as Meta’s former promises about a metaverse where \"you're gonna be able to do almost anything you can imagine.\" Kyle Orland Senior Gaming Editor Kyle Orland Senior Gaming Editor Kyle Orland has been the Senior Gaming Editor at Ars Technica since 2012, writing primarily about the business, tech, and culture behind video games.

    "content": "LimeWire AI Studio Review 2023: Details, Pricing & Features Adil Ahmad December 12, 2023 0 In the rapidly advancing landscape of AI technology and innovation, LimeWire emerges as a unique platform in the realm of generative AI tools. This platform not only stands out from the multitude of existing AI tools but also brings a fresh approach to content generation. LimeWire not only empowers users to create AI content but also provides creators with creative ways to share and monetize their creations. As we explore LimeWire, our aim is to uncover its features, benefits for creators, and the exciting possibilities it offers for AI content generation. This platform presents an opportunity for users to harness the power of AI in image creation, all while enjoying the advantages of a free and accessible service. Let's unravel the distinctive features that set LimeWire apart in the dynamic landscape of AI-powered tools, understanding how creators can leverage its capabilities to craft unique and engaging AI-generated images. Introduction LimeWire, a name once associated with the notorious file-sharing tool from the 2000s, has undergone a significant transformation. The LimeWire we discuss today is not the file-sharing application of the past but has re-emerged as an entirely new entity—a cutting-edge AI content publishing platform. This revamped LimeWire invites users to register and unleash their creativity by crafting original AI content, which can then be shared and showcased on the LimeWire Studio. Notably, even acclaimed artists and musicians, such as Deadmau5, Soulja Boy, and Sean Kingston, have embraced this platform to publish their content in the form of NFT music, videos, and images. Beyond providing a space for content creation and sharing, LimeWire introduces monetization models to empower users to earn revenue from their creations. This includes avenues such as earning ad revenue and participating in the burgeoning market of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). As we delve further, we'll explore these monetization strategies in more detail to provide a comprehensive understanding of LimeWire's innovative approach to content creation and distribution. LimeWire Studio welcomes content creators into its fold, providing a space to craft personalized AI-focused content for sharing with fans and followers. Within this creative hub, every piece of content generated becomes not just a creation but a unique asset—ownable and tradable. Fans have the opportunity to subscribe to creators' pages, immersing themselves in the creative journey and gaining ownership of digital collectibles that hold tradeable value within the LimeWire community. Notably, creators earn a 2.5% royalty each time their content is traded, adding a rewarding element to the creative process. The platform's flexibility is evident in its content publication options. Creators can choose to share their work freely with the public or opt for a premium subscription model, granting exclusive access to specialized content for subscribers. LimeWire AI Studio As of the present moment, LimeWire focuses on AI Image Generation, offering a spectrum of creative possibilities to its user base. The platform, however, has ambitious plans on the horizon, aiming to broaden its offerings by introducing AI music and video generation tools in the near future. This strategic expansion promises creators even more avenues for expression and engagement with their audience, positioning LimeWire Studio as a dynamic and evolving platform within the realm of AI-powered content creation. AI Image Generation Tools The LimeWire AI image generation tool presents a versatile platform for both the creation and editing of images. Supporting advanced models such as Stable Diffusion 2.1, Stable Diffusion XL, and DALL-E 2, LimeWire offers a sophisticated toolkit for users to delve into the realm of generative AI art. Much like other tools in the generative AI landscape, LimeWire provides a range of options catering to various levels of complexity in image creation. Users can initiate the creative process with prompts as simple as a few words or opt for more intricate instructions, tailoring the output to their artistic vision. What sets LimeWire apart is its seamless integration of different AI models and design styles. Users have the flexibility to effortlessly switch between various AI models, exploring diverse design styles such as cinematic, digital art, pixel art, anime, analog film, and more. Each style imparts a distinctive visual identity to the generated AI art, enabling users to explore a broad spectrum of creative possibilities. The platform also offers additional features, including samplers, allowing users to fine-tune the quality and detail levels of their creations.

    "title": "‘It’s harsh. It’s mean, brutal’: Trump bill to cause most harm to America’s poorest",
    "source": "The Guardian",
    "content": "L ast November, Donald Trump made a solemn vow to all Americans: “Every citizen, I will fight for you, your family and your future every single day.” Eight months later, Trump is vigorously backing many policies that will mean pain for millions. Trump has pushed to enact the Republican budget bill , which would make significant cuts to Medicaid, Obamacare, and food assistance, and would do the greatest damage to those Americans struggling hardest to make ends meet – the 30% of the US population that lives in households earning under $50,000 a year. Even as Trump and Republican lawmakers are rushing to cut over $1.4tn in health and food assistance for non-affluent Americans, Trump continues to pressure Congress to extend over $3tn in tax cuts that disproportionately help the wealthy and corporations. Trump has embraced these Robin-Hood-in-reverse policies, even though it was voters earning less than $50,000 a year who delivered victory to him last November. They favored him over Kamala Harris by 50% to 48%, according to exit polls, while Trump and Harris tied among voters earning $50,000 or more a year. Several social policy experts said Trump has engaged in hypocrisy at best and betrayal at worst when it comes to the working-class and blue-collar Americans he promised to fight for. Speaking about the Republicans’ “big, beautiful” budget bill, Sharon Parrott, president of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, said: “Who’s getting hit, who’s bearing the cost? It’s people with low and middle incomes, people that the president and many Republican policymakers promised to serve and support in the last election.” View image in fullscreen Mike Johnson talks to reporters in Washington on Wednesday. Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images The budget bill would mean a net financial loss for the bottom 30% of American households by income – after factoring in its tax provisions and cuts in benefits. The House bill would hit the lowest-earning 10% of Americans hardest: for them, it would mean a painful $1,600 cut in income on average (a 3.9% drop), according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). At the same time, the Trump-backed bill would be a boon to wealthy households – it would mean a $12,000 increase in net income, on average, for households in the top 10%, those earning above $692,000 a year. According to the Yale Budget Lab, the top 0.1% – those with income over $3.3m – would receive tax cuts of $103,500 on average. The CBO says the income of the bottom 10% tops off at $22,868 (before factoring in government transfers). The second lowest decile earns from $22,868 to $43,137; the third decile earns up to $55,628; and the fourth up to $68,601. The Yale Budget Lab found that the bottom 20% of US households would see their incomes drop by 2.9% on average over the next decade, and the second lowest quintile – moderate-income households – would suffer a 0.4% loss of income on average. But the richest 20% would see their incomes rise by 2.3%. Those in the top 1% would see their incomes climb by $29,585 on average. Trump is demanding these big tax cuts for the rich even though the CBO says the budget bill will increase the federal debt by $3.3tn – a move that will push up interest rates and make mortgages and home-buying more expensive. According to the Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning thinktank, the $121bn tax cuts that would go just to the richest 1% next year are significantly more than all the tax cuts that would go to the bottom 60% of Americans in terms of income. The poorest 20% of Americans would receive just 1% of the bill’s tax cuts next year, while the highest earning 5% would receive 44% of the cuts. Last week, Trump urged lawmakers to enact the bill, saying: “There are hundreds of things in there. It is so good .” At a news conference, the president said the more than $1tn in Medicaid and food assistance cuts wouldn’t hurt anyone. “It won’t affect anybody ,” he said. “It is just fraud, waste and abuse.” But Parrott took a sharply different view: “The bill stands alone historically for its unique upside-down mix of large tax cuts for the top, deep cuts that affect low- and middle-income people, and massive increases in deficits and debt.” John Ricco, the Yale Budget Lab’s associate director of policy analysis, said: “It’s unambiguous that low- and moderate-income Americans will be worse off on average under the budget bill, and that’s principally because the cuts in Medicaid and Snap [the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] would by definition fall most heavily on these groups,” Ricco said. Jeanne Lambrew, the Century Foundation’s director of health policy reform, estimates that at least 16 million Americans will lose health coverage because of the budget bill – refuting White House claims that “no one will lose coverage”. Lambrew said the bill would cause a more than 50% increase in the number of uninsured nationwide, to nearly 45 million people. What’s more, the Trump-backed plan sharply reduces Affordable Care Act subsidies, and that will force millions of Americans to either drop coverage or pay far more for coverage. Millions of Americans will find it harder to obtain healthcare, with many forced to take on far more medical debt. While Trump and many Republicans say the Medicaid cuts are all about reducing “waste, fraud and abuse”, Lambrew calculates that a mere 3.5% of the $1tn in healthcare cuts come from cutting waste and abuse. “What Trump has been saying is, ‘We’re not cutting Medicaid. We’re just cutting fraud.’ That’s gaslighting.” Lambrew said. Archbishop Timothy Broglio, president of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, sent the Senate a letter that harshly criticized the budget bill . “As Pope Leo XIV recently stated, it is the responsibility of politicians to promote and protect the common good, including by working to overcome great wealth inequality,” he wrote. “This bill does not answer this call. It takes from the poor to give to the wealthy.” According to a Quinnipiac University poll , only 27% of registered voters support the GOP budget bill, while 53% oppose it. A Fox News poll found that 38% support the bill, while 59% oppose it. The House bill’s deep cuts in food benefits will cause 7 million people, including over 2 million children, to lose food aid or have their food aid cut significantly. The Trump-supported bill also makes sharp cuts in Pell grant awards. The Center for American Progress says this means 4.4 million students from low- and moderate-income families could lose some or all of their federal grant aid. In another blow to Americans earning under $50,000, Trump pushed to have the budget bill eliminate the “Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program”, which, as one website put it, “keeps poor people from freezing to death at home”. Killing the program would end heating subsidies for 6 million Americans, but so far congressional Republicans have spared the program and not bowed to Trump on this.

Photograph: Piroschka Van De Wouw/Reuters In another blow to blue-collar Americans, the bill would undo much of Joe Biden’s efforts to speed the creation of clean-energy industries, and that could put hundreds of thousands of potential jobs at risk, many of them factory jobs. “In this bill, folks in Congress went out of their way not to give anything to low-income people,” said Chuck Marr, vice-president for federal tax policy at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. He noted that in previous tax cut bills that favored the rich, GOP lawmakers made sure to include some sweeteners for low- and moderate-income Americans. “But in this bill,” Marr said, “folks in Congress said: no, we’re going to go after these people. They’re going after healthcare and food, and these are the people who are also going to get hammered by Trump’s tariffs.” Lower-income people spend a higher percentage of their income on goods. “This bill is a major shift,” Marr added. “They’re taking away from poor people and working-class people and channeling it to very high-income people. I think it’s punitive. It’s harsh. It’s mean, brutal.” Trump’s tariffs would also hit less affluent Americans hardest. One study found that Trump’s planned tariffs would cause the bottom 20% of households to pay up to 5.5% of their income toward tariff-caused higher prices. That’s more than two and a half times the percentage that those in the top 20% would pay (2.1% of income). Trump has repeatedly boasted that the bill contains several provisions he championed to help working-class Americans. At a White House event to promote the bill, he pointed to a DoorDash driver from Wisconsin who was on hand to help make his case that the “no tax on tips” provision would help workers. But tax experts say that provision will help only a tiny fraction of those earning under $50,000 . Only 4% of workers in the bottom half by income are in tipped jobs. Moreover, nearly two-fifths of tipped workers are already earning so little that they don’t pay federal income taxes. “Given how the current income tax system works, this provision will provide little or no benefit to those workers,” said Ricco. “Those workers tend to have low incomes, and the US system doesn’t basically tax their incomes, and this won’t offer them any additional tax reduction.” In other words, the server making $100,000 a year at a high-end restaurant will benefit substantially from no tax on tips, while the hotel housekeeper or 20-hour-a-week waiter at a diner making $25,000 a year will be helped little or not at all. As for Trump’s much-ballyhooed “no tax on overtime” provision, that, too, will do little for those earning under $50,000, Ricco said. “That provision is really geared to middle- and upper-middle groups,” he said. “People in the bottom 50% aren’t paying much income tax, and so no tax on overtime wouldn’t benefit them much. People in the bottom 40%, they’re often in a precarious employment situation. They’re generally not working 45 or 50 hours a week.” Ricco estimated that for Americans in the bottom 40% by income, the no tax on overtime provision will mean “less than a $10 tax cut per year”. “It’s essentially a rounding error,” he said. Republicans boast that increasing the child-tax credit will help millions of struggling families – the House bill would increase that credit, now $2,000, to $2,500, while the Senate raises it to $2,200. Under current law, one in four children – about 17 million – are ineligible to qualify for the full $2,000 credit because their family’s income is too low to qualify for the full credit. A two-parent family with two children needs to earn over $48,000 to obtain the full credit. Under the House bill, a single parent with two children who earns $16,000 a year would get no additional tax credit, while a married couple with two kids and a $400,000 income would see their tax credit jump by $1,000. With their eagerness to cut the social safety net, Republicans seem to be treating millions of Americans who earn less than $50,000 as undeserving takers. “People earning under $50,000 are major targets of the Republican agenda. Their health coverage is targeted. Their food security is targeted,” said Marr. “They are left out of key provisions expanding tax cuts, like the child tax credit. They are most at risk from the Republican tariffs. They’ll be hurt across the board.” Marr said the budget bill treats “these people very harshly”. “It’s the harshest bill we’ve ever seen since budget deficits became an issue 40 years ago,” he said. “This is the first bill that simultaneously targets programs for poor people and working-class people to pay for it, and then takes that money to pay for tax cuts for very wealthy people. It makes poor and working-class people worse off. That’s not been done before.”",

    "title": "EU closing in on ‘framework’ trade deal with US to avoid Trump’s 50% tariffs",
    "source": "The Guardian",
    "content": "The EU and US are closing in on a high-level “framework” trade deal that would avert 50% tariffs on all exports from the bloc next Wednesday, Donald Trump’s self-imposed deadline. Talks in Washington could go down to the wire, but diplomats and officials said the EU was willing to accept Trump’s 10% blanket tariffs. Negotiators will only accept this, however, in exchange for an extension in talks and possible concessions on a 25% car tariff, which is hurting the German car industry, sources said. The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, hinted a deal was possible after meeting the EU’s trade chief, Maroš Šefčovič , on Thursday morning in Washington. “We’ll see what we can do with the EU,” he told reporters at a wider briefing on treasury matters, declaring on the eve of 4 July celebrations that the US was “going to see a lot more trade deals”. The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, and the US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, are scheduled to continue talks with Šefčovič on Thursday afternoon. EU ambassadors are expected to be briefed on the talks on Friday. Bessent said Greer would be “working diligently over the weekend” with European officials. Trump has threatened to impose 50% tariffs on all EU goods from 9 July unless the two sides reach a deal. Most EU goods already face a 10% tariff, with levies of 25% on cars and car parts and 50% on steel and aluminium. The push for a narrowly focused UK-style agreement in principle comes days after the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, reiterated his calls for a quick deal. “It is better to achieve a quick and simple solution than a lengthy and complicated one that remains in the negotiation stage for months,” he said in Berlin. Merz said a quick deal was needed “to remove the burden of tariffs on our businesses, which are far too high”, and that the current talks were “not about a minutely detailed trade deal” but “the quick resolution of a tariff dispute”. Šefčovič was seeking a standstill clause to provide “guarantees that the US can stand over” that there would be no imposition of new tariffs in any extension period, said one politician with knowledge of the talks. One EU diplomat said they expected a deal “if not this week then before Wednesday”, because it was “in everybody’s interest”. “It will be very high level, but enough for Trump to declare victory,” said one source. Some believe a deal could even be struck this week, giving the US president a significant announcement on 4 July Independence Day celebrations on Friday. Talks between the EU and the US have been taking place since early April when Trump imposed tariffs on 60-plus countries in a theatrical “liberation day” presentation. He has concluded a formal deal with only one of those countries, the UK, although he claims to have struck agreements with Vietnam and China . One source said the EU delegation that flew to Washington for talks in April was handed a “massive tome” on US “grievances, country by country”. “There were about 30 pages on the EU alone,” they said. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Sources in Berlin said Merz took some time to persuade the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, to switch tack and pursue a UK-style approach. Von der Leyen said on Thursday: “Indeed, what we are aiming at is an agreement in principle, because [with] such a volume, in 90 days, an agreement in detail, it’s impossible … That is also what the UK did. And as far as I’m informed, there are only two countries so far worldwide that have concluded with an agreement in principle.” Others said Merz’s frustration lay with the approach of a European institution used to dealing with 27 member states and the minute detail of regulation. They also indicated that the US’s latest proposal – sent to EU leaders last Wednesday – “did not include any details on … concessions from the US side”. In a briefing to EU ambassadors this week, von der Leyen’s chief of staff, Bjoern Seibert, and the director general of the commission’s trade department, Sabine Weyand, told member states the US wanted deals on four areas including tariffs. The other three issues were strategically important sectors such as pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, economic purchases such as oil and gas, and non-trade barriers including tech, food and car regulation, all red lines for the EU.",

    "title": "US adds 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing expectations amid Trump trade war",
    "source": "The Guardian",
    "content": "The US economy added 147,000 jobs in June, a sign of continuing strength in the labor market amid Donald Trump ’s trade war. The number of jobs added surpassed expectations, as economists largely anticipated a drop in openings. Instead, 3 ,000 more jobs were added in June compared with May, according to new job figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The unemployment rate actually decreased to 4.1%, down from 4.2% in May. Job gains were seen in state government and healthcare, which saw increases of 47,000 and 39,000 jobs, respectively. Meanwhile, federal government job losses continued, with another 7,000 roles down in June, as the Trump administration continues to cut jobs. The total job loss in the federal government has been 69,000 since January. Though the president’s tariffs have rocked the US stock market, which has seen a dramatic rebound after dipping down 15% in the spring, economists have been worrying that the labor market has just been slower to show sensitivity to the tariffs. New data had shown employers showing signs of hesitancy. The payroll firm ADP found that the private sector lost 33,000 jobs in June, far below the 100,000 increase that was expected, and the first decrease since March 2023. The dip in job openings does no necessarily mean companies are laying off more workers; rather, they are creating fewer new positions. “Though layoffs continue to be rare, a hesitancy to hire and a reluctance to replace departing workers led to job losses last month,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP, in a statement. John Waldron, president of Goldman Sachs, said the American economy was “breaking more to the positive” than many expected after Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs in early April. “The US economy is surprisingly resilient, both in terms of consumer spend [and] the labor dynamic,” Waldron told reporters on Thursday. “And just general economic economic activity is stronger than one might have guessed if you were sitting here on April 3, projecting what the tariff policy would deliver.” Data from BLS that measures job openings and turnovers in the labor market found that while job openings had climbed in May, to its highest level since November, the vast majority of openings were concentrated in the leisure and hospitality industry. Economists with Citigroup said the spike in new jobs could be temporary as companies opened new positions in response to Trump’s crackdown on immigrants , fearing that immigrant employees could lose work permits. The White House has spent the last few months downplaying the impact tariffs have on the domestic economy, despite anxiety from consumers and businesses over the impact tariffs have on prices. The deadline for Trump’s 90-day pause on some of his highest tariffs is scheduled to expire next week, as the White House tries to broker deals with dozens of countries that could face high tariffs. Federal Reserve chair blames Trump’s tariffs for preventing interest rate cuts Read more The White House announced on Tuesday a deal with Vietnam , whose products were scheduled to face a 46% tariff. The country agreed to a 20% tariff rate, with no tariffs placed on US exports. The deal with Vietnam follows deals Trump has made with the UK and China, but there are dozens of other countries whose exports could face high tariffs without a deal. Amid economic uncertainty, Trump has tried to pass blame on to the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell . On Monday, Trump sent an open letter to Powell demanding that the Fed lower interest rates. “He’s costing us a fortune because he keeps the rate way up,” Trump wrote on social media. Powell, in turn, has said that the Fed has not lowered interest rates because of economic uncertainty caused by Trump’s tariffs. “In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs,” Powell said. “Essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs.”",

    "title": "Google undercounts its carbon emissions, report finds",
    "source": "The Guardian",
    "content": "In 2021, Google set a lofty goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2030. Yet in the years since then, the company has moved in the opposite direction as it invests in energy-intensive artificial intelligence. In its latest sustainability report , Google said its carbon emissions had increased 51% between 2019 and 2024. New research aims to debunk even that enormous figure and provide context to Google’s sustainability reports, painting a bleaker picture. A report authored by non-profit advocacy group Kairos Fellowship found that, between 2019 and 2024, Google’s carbon emissions actually went up by 65%. What’s more, between 2010 , the first year there is publicly available data on Google’s emissions, and 2024, Google’s total greenhouse gas emissions increased 1,515%, Kairos found. The largest year-over-year jump in that window was also the most recent, 2023 to 2024, when Google saw a 26% increase in emissions just between 2023 and 2024, according to the report. “Google’s own data makes it clear: the corporation is contributing to the acceleration of climate catastrophe, and the metrics that matter – how many emissions they emit, how much water they use, and how fast these trends are accelerating – are headed in the wrong direction for us and the planet,” said Nicole Sugerman, a campaign manager at Kairos Fellowship. The authors say that they found the vast majority of the numbers they used to determine how much energy Google is using and how much its carbon emissions are increasing in the appendices of Google’s own sustainability reports. Many of those numbers were not highlighted in the main body of Google’s reports, they say. Revealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areas Read more After the report published, Google called its findings into question in a statement. “The analysis by the Kairos Fellowship distorts the facts. Our carbon emissions are calculated according to the widely used Greenhouse Gas Protocol and assured by a third party. Our carbon reduction ambition has been validated by the leading industry body, the Science Based Targets initiative,” said a spokesperson, Maggie Shiels. The authors behind the report, titled Google’s Eco-Failures, attribute the discrepancy between the numbers they calculated and the numbers Google highlights in its sustainability reports to various factors, including that the firm uses a different metric for calculating how much its emissions have increased. While Google uses market-based emissions, the researchers used location-based emissions. Location-based emissions are the average emissions the company produces from its use of local power grids, while market-based emissions include energy the company has purchased to offset its total emissions. “[Location-based emissions] represents a company’s ‘real’ grid emissions,” said Franz Ressel, the lead researcher and report co-author. “Market-based emissions are a corporate-friendly metric that obscures a polluter’s actual impact on the environment. It allows companies to pollute in one place, and try to ‘offset’ those emissions by purchasing energy contracts in another place.” The energy the tech giant has needed to purchase to power its data centers alone increased 820% since 2010, according to Kairos’s research, a figure that is expected to expand in the future as Google rolls out more AI products. Between 2019 and 2024, emissions that came primarily from the purchase of electricity to power data centers jumped 121%, the report’s authors said. “In absolute terms, the increase was 6.8 TWh, or the equivalent of Google adding the entire state of Alaska’s energy use in one year to their previous use,” said Sugerman. Based on Google’s current trajectory, the Kairos report’s authors say the company is unlikely to meet its own 2030 deadline without a significant push from the public. There are three categories of greenhouse gas emissions – called Scopes 1, 2 and 3 – and Google has only meaningfully decreased its Scope 1 emissions since 2019, according to the Kairos report. Scope 1 emissions, which include emissions just from Google’s own facilities and vehicles, account for only 0.31% of the company’s total emissions, according to the report. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions that come primarily from the electricity Google purchases to power its facilities, and scope 3 accounts for indirect emissions from all other sources such as suppliers, use of Google’s consumer devices or employee business travel. “It’s not sustainable to keep building at the rate [Google is] building because they need to scale their compute within planetary limits,” said Sugerman. “We do not have enough green energy to serve the needs of Google and certainly not the needs of Google and the rest of us.” Thirsty, power-hungry data centers As the company builds out resource-intensive data centers across the country, experts are also paying close attention to Google’s water usage. According to the company’s own sustainability report, Google’s water withdrawal – how much water is taken from various sources – increased 27% between 2023 and 2024 to 11bn gallons of water. The amount is “enough to supply the potable water needs for the 2.5 million people and 5,500 industrial users in Boston and its suburbs for 55 days”, according to the Kairos report. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Tech companies have faced both internal and public pressure to power their growing number of data centers with clean energy. Amazon employees recently put forth a package of shareholder proposals that asked the company to disclose its overall carbon emissions and targeted the climate impact of its data centers. The proposals were ultimately voted down. On Sunday, several organizations including Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, League of Conservation Voters, Public Citizen and the Sierra Club, published an open letter in the San Francisco Chronicle and the Seattle Times calling on the CEOs of Google, Amazon and Microsoft to “commit to no new gas and zero delayed coal plant retirements to power your data centers”. “In just the last two years alone, your companies have built data centers throughout the United States capable of consuming more electricity than four million American homes,” the letter reads. “Within five years, your data centers alone will use more electricity than 22 million households, rivaling the consumption of multiple mid-size states.” Google’s emissions up 51% as AI electricity demand derails efforts to go green Read more In its own sustainability report, Google warns that the firm’s “future trajectories” may be affected by the “evolving landscape” of the tech industry. “We’re at an extraordinary inflection point, not just for our company specifically, but for the technology industry as a whole – driven by the rapid growth of AI,” the report reads. “The combination of AI’s potential for non-linear growth driven by its unprecedented pace of development and the uncertain scale of clean energy and infrastructure needed to meet this growth makes it harder to predict our future emissions and could impact our ability to reduce them.” The Kairos report accuses Google of relying “heavily on speculative technologies, particularly nuclear power”, to achieve its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2030. “Google’s emphasis on nuclear energy as a clean energy ‘solution’ is particularly concerning, given the growing consensus among both scientists and business experts that their successful deployment on scale, if it is to ever occur, cannot be achieved in the near or mid-term future,” the report reads. The Kairos report alleges the way that Google presents some of its data is misleading. In the case of data center emissions, for example, Google says it has improved the energy efficiency of its data centers by 50% over 13 years. Citing energy efficiency numbers rather than sharing absolute ones obscures Google’s total emissions, the authors argue. “In fact, since 2010, the company’s total energy consumption has increased 1,282%,” the report concluded.",

    "title": "Paramount settles with Trump for $16m over ‘60 Minutes’ Kamala Harris interview",
    "source": "The Guardian",
    "content": "Donald Trump has reached a $16m settlement with Paramount , the parent of CBS News, over what he claimed was false editing of a pre-election interview with the Democratic candidate for president, Kamala Harris, in what is likely to be seen as a further example of capitulation by media companies hoping to smooth the waters with Trump. Trump had filed a $10bn lawsuit against the company in October, one of a string of legal actions against US media conglomerates over what the US president maintains was biased, incorrect or “fake” news reporting. In a late-night announcement, Paramount – which is preparing for a $8.4bn merger that requires approval from the the US Federal Communications Commission, headed by Trump loyalist Brendan Carr – said it would pay the sum to settle the suit. It said the money would be allocated, at Trump’s discretion, either to his future presidential library or to charitable causes, and not paid to Trump “directly or indirectly”. “The settlement does not include a statement of apology or regret,” the company statement added. A spokesperson for Trump’s legal team told the Wall Street Journal that the settlement was “another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit”. The lawsuit alleged that CBS , via its news show 60 Minutes, deceptively edited an interview with Harris – then the US vice-president as well as the Democratic presidential candidate – to “tip the scales in favor of the Democratic party” in the election. On the campaign trail last year, Trump threatened to revoke CBS’s broadcasting licence if elected. The lawsuit also alleged that CBS aired two versions of the interview in which Harris appeared to give different answers to the same question about the Israel-Hamas war. CBS said the lawsuit was “completely without merit” and had asked a judge to dismiss it. In an amended complaint filed in February, Trump increased his claim for damages to $20bn and added a claim that CBS’s editing of the interview violated the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, which makes it illegal to use false, misleading or deceptive acts in commerce. The lawsuit was filed in Amarillo, Texas, a portion of a federal district court where the sole judge is a 2019 Trump appointee. The case entered mediation in April. The settlement includes an agreement that 60 Minutes would release transcripts of interviews with future US presidential candidates after they aired, subject to redactions as required for legal or national security concerns. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Edward A Paltzik, a lawyer representing Trump in the civil suit, could not be immediately reached for comment. Paltzik has previously said “real accountability for CBS and Paramount will ensure that the president is compensated for the harm done to him, and will deter the fake news from further distorting the facts to advance a partisan agenda”. The settlement comes as Paramount prepares for an $8.4bn merger with Skydance Media, which requires the approval of federal regulators at the FCC. But US and California lawmakers have said any settlement may violate bribery laws. “Paramount appears to be trying to settle a lawsuit that it has assessed as ‘completely without merit’,” the Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Ron Wyden said in a May letter to Paramount’s chair, Shari Redstone. “Under the federal bribery statute, it is illegal to corruptly give anything of value to public officials to influence an official act. “If Paramount officials make these concessions in a quid pro quo arrangement to influence President Trump or other Administration officials, they may be breaking the law.” Sanders said it was “a dark day for independent journalism and freedom of the press – an essential part of our democracy. It is a victory for a president who is attempting to stifle dissent and undermine American democracy.” The settlement is the latest example of media corporate parent companies making concessions to Trump and the Trump administration , which frequently casts unfavorable coverage as “fake news”. On Tuesday, Trump and the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, threatened to sue CNN over its reporting on an app designed to help people avoid Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, and over the reporting of a damage assessment on Iran’s nuclear facilities that was unfavorable to the administration’s claims. The settlement also comes after Meta Platforms, the Facebook and Instagram parent company, said on 29 January it had agreed to pay about $25m to settle a lawsuit by Trump over the company’s suspension of his accounts after the 6 January 2021 attack at the US Capitol. Paramount’s decision to settle the case – which has reportedly caused deep upset in the CBS newsroom – also follows ABC News agreeing to pay $15m to Trump to settle a defamation lawsuit over inaccurate comments by the anchor George Stephanopoulos that Trump had been found civilly liable for rape.",

    "title": "Tesla vehicle deliveries drop sharply as Musk backlash affects demand",
    "source": "The Guardian",
    "content": "Tesla posted another big drop in quarterly deliveries on Wednesday, putting it on course for its second straight annual sales decline as demand falters due to backlash over CEO Elon Musk’s political stance and an ageing vehicle lineup. Tesla said it delivered 384,122 vehicles in the second quarter, down 13.5% from 443,956 units a year ago. Analysts had expected it to report deliveries of about 394,378 vehicles, according to an average of 23 estimates from the financial research firm Visible Alpha, though projections went to as low as 360,080 units based on estimates from 10 analysts over the past month. Analysts use the number of vehicles delivered to customers as a metric of success to evaluate both automotive sales and production. Tesla shares fall as company reports first decline in annual deliveries Read more “The market is reacting to the deliveries not being as bad as potentially thought with multiple analysts cutting their forecasts over the past week,” said Seth Goldstein, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. The stock has lost 25% of its value so far this year as investors feared brand damage in Europe, where sales have slumped most sharply, and in the US from Musk’s embrace of rightwing politics and his role in spearheading the Trump administration’s cost-cutting effort. The day Trump and Musk split publicly in early June, Tesla lost about $150bn in market value. Its share price has somewhat recovered in the ensuing month, but Trump and Musk have likewise reignited their feud as they spar over Trump’s sweeping tax bill. Tesla’s plummeting deliveries in a steadily growing global EV market come despite Musk saying in April that sales had turned around. The company refreshed its top-selling Model Y crossover earlier this year to boost demand, but the redesign forced a production halt and prompted some buyers to delay purchases in anticipation of the updated version. Most of Tesla’s revenue and profit come from its core EV business, and much of its trillion-dollar valuation hangs on Musk’s big bet on converting its vehicles into robotaxis. Tesla last month rolled out a robotaxi service in limited parts of Austin, Texas, for a select group of invitees and with several restrictions, including having a safety monitor in the front passenger seat. The pilot was limited, though, with only about a dozen Robotaxis on the road. The US National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration opened an investigation into the launch of the autonomous ride service. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion ‘Lidar is lame’: why Elon Musk’s vision for a self-driving Tesla taxi faltered Read more The automaker had said it would start producing a cheaper vehicle, expected to be a pared-down Model Y, by June’s end. While a cheaper model might help bolster sales, Wall Street expects a second consecutive annual sales decline this year. To achieve Musk’s target of returning to growth this year, Tesla would need to hand over more than a million units in the second half – a record and a tough challenge, according to analysts, despite typically stronger sales in the second half.",

Nehru was an erudite product of Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge; Donald Trump, for all his expensive education, is ultimately a rough-and-tumble graduate of New York real estate. A freedom fighter before becoming prime minister, Nehru spent nine years in British-run jails having campaigned against imperial rule; Mr Trump’s tangles with the law have involved hush money for a porn star. Nevertheless, Nehru’s Fabian socialism—a patrician distrust of commerce mixed with an intellectual love of scientific progress—means his views on trade are, many years later, mirrored by Mr Trump’s America-first instincts.
